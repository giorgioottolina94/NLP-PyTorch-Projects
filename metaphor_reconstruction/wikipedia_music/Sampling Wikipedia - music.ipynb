rhythmic pattern, echoed by another drum playing the same pattern',' There have been seven editions of the tour, five in North America and two in Australasia',' The name of the tour is from the lyrics of \"Droppin\\' Plates\" on Disturbed\\'s first album, The Sickness','', 'Baroque music (UK:  or US: ) is a period or style of Western classical music composed from approximately 1600 to 1750',' The Baroque period is divided into three major phases: early, middle, and late',' The term \"baroque\" comes from the Portuguese word barroco, meaning \"misshapen pearl\"',' Key composers of the Baroque era include Johann Sebastian Bach, Antonio Vivaldi, George Frideric Handel, Claudio Monteverdi, Domenico Scarlatti, Alessandro Scarlatti, Henry Purcell, Georg Philipp Telemann, Jean-Baptiste Lully, Jean-Philippe Rameau, Marc-Antoine Charpentier, Arcangelo Corelli, François Couperin, Giuseppe Tartini, Heinrich Schütz, Jan Pieterszoon Sweelinck, Dieterich Buxtehude, and others',' Baroque concerts were typically accompanied by a basso continuo group (comprising chord-playing instrumentalists such as harpsichordists and lute players improvising chords from a figured bass part) while a group of bass instruments—viol, cello, double bass—played the bassline',' Dense, complex polyphonic music, in which multiple independent melody lines were performed simultaneously (a popular example of this is the fugue), was an important part of many Baroque choral and instrumental works','', 'Musical composition, music composition or simply composition, can refer to an original piece or work of music, either vocal or instrumental, the structure of a musical piece or to the process of creating or writing a new piece of music',' People who create new compositions are called composers',' Composers of primarily songs are usually called songwriters; with songs, the person who writes lyrics for a song is the lyricist',' In many cultures, including Western classical music, the act of composing typically includes the creation of music notation, such as a sheet music \"score,\" which is then performed by the composer or by other musicians',' In popular music and traditional music, songwriting may involve the creation of a basic outline of the song, called the lead sheet, which sets out the melody, lyrics and chord progression',' In classical music, orchestration (choosing the instruments of a large music ensemble such as an orchestra which will play the different parts of music, such as the melody, accompaniment, countermelody, bassline and so on) is typically done by the composer, but in musical theatre and in pop music, songwriters may hire an arranger to do the orchestration',' In some cases, a pop or traditional songwriter may not use written notation at all and instead compose the song in their mind and then play, sing or record it from memory','\\nAlthough a musical composition often uses musical notation and has a single author, this is not always the case',' A work of music can have multiple composers, which often occurs in popular music when all members of a band collaborate to write a song or in musical theatre, when one person writes the melodies, a second person writes the lyrics and a third person orchestrates the songs',' \\nA piece of music can also be composed with words, images or, since the 20th century, with computer programs that explain or notate how the singer or musician should create musical sounds',' Examples range from 20th century avant-garde music that uses graphic notation, to text compositions such as Karlheinz Stockhausen\\'s Aus den sieben Tagen, to computer programs that select sounds for musical pieces',' A more commonly known example of chance-based, or indeterminate, music is the sound of wind chimes jingling in a breeze','nan','nan',' The second is the rendering audible of two or more simultaneous sounds in such a manner that their combination is pleasant','', 'In music theory, the key of a piece is the group of pitches, or scale, that forms the basis of a music composition in classical, Western art, and Western pop music','\\nThe group features a tonic note and its corresponding chords, also called a tonic or tonic chord, which provides a subjective sense of arrival and rest, and also has a unique relationship to the other pitches of the same group, their corresponding chords, and pitches and chords outside the group','\\nThe key may be in the major or minor mode, though musicians assume major when this is not specified, e','g',', \"This piece is in C\" implies that the key of the song is C major','', 'Contemporary classical music is classical music composed close to the present day','', 'Chamber music is a form of classical music that is composed for a small group of instruments—traditionally a group that could fit in a palace chamber or a large room',' Most broadly, it includes any art music that is performed by a small number of performers, with one performer to a part (in contrast to orchestral music, in which each string part is played by a number of performers)',' Playing chamber music requires special skills, both musical and social, that differ from the skills required for playing solo or symphonic works',' In the United States, the term is mostly used to refer electronic music generally','', 'Hindustani classical music is the classical music of northern regions of the Indian subcontinent',' It may also be called North Indian classical music or, in Hindustani, Shastriya Sangeet (śāstriya saṅgīt)',' Its origins date from the 12th century CE, when it diverged from Carnatic music, the classical tradition of southern regions of the Indian subcontinent','', 'Sheet music is a handwritten or printed form of musical notation that uses musical symbols to indicate the pitches, rhythms, or chords of a song or instrumental musical piece',' Like its analogs – printed books or pamphlets in English, Arabic, or other languages – the medium of sheet music typically is paper (or, in earlier centuries, papyrus or parchment), although the access to musical notation since the 1980s has included the presentation of musical notation on computer screens and the development of scorewriter computer programs that can notate a song or piece electronically, and, in some cases, \"play back\" the notated music using a synthesizer or virtual instruments','\\nUse of the term \"sheet\" is intended to differentiate written or printed forms of music from sound recordings (on vinyl record, cassette, CD), radio or TV broadcasts or recorded live performances, which may capture film or video footage of the performance as well as the audio component',' In everyday use, \"sheet music\" (or simply \"music\") can refer to the print publication of commercial sheet music in conjunction with the release of a new film, TV show, record album, or other special or popular event which involves music',' The first printed sheet music made with a printing press was made in 1473','\\nThe term score is a common alternative (and more generic) term for sheet music, and there are several types of scores, as discussed below',' The term score can also refer to theatre music, orchestral music or songs written for a play, musical, opera or ballet, or to music or songs written for a television programme or film; for the last of these, see Film score',' It is prevalent in Central, Northern and Southeast Europe (in particular Germany, Austria, Albania, Bulgaria, Finland, Slovakia, Slovenia, Serbia, Croatia, Poland, Hungary, Romania, Switzerland, Scandinavia, and the Baltic states), and also (to a lesser extent) in France, Belgium, and the Netherlands',' In the United States it is also known as \\'entertainer music\\' or \\'German hit mix\\'','\\nThe German word Schlager is also a loanword in some other languages (such as Hungarian, Lithuanian, Serbian, Russian, Hebrew, and Romanian, for example), where it retained its meaning of a \"(musical) hit\"','', \"A music download (commonly referred to as a digital download) is the digital transfer of music via the Internet into a device capable of decoding and playing it, such as a personal computer, portable media player, MP3 player or smartphone',' This term encompasses both legal downloads and downloads of copyrighted material without permission or legal payment',' According to a Nielsen report, downloadable music accounted for 55','9 percent of all music sales in the US in 2012',' By the beginning of 2011, Apple's iTunes Store alone made US$1',' Music downloads are typically encoded with modified discrete cosine transform (MDCT) audio data compression, particularly the Advanced Audio Coding (AAC) format used by iTunes as well as the MP3 audio coding format','\", 'Renaissance music is vocal and instrumental music written and performed in Europe during the Renaissance era','\\nFrom the Renaissance era, notated secular and sacred music survives in quantity, including vocal and instrumental works and mixed vocal/instrumental works',' Ensembles specializing in music of the Renaissance era give concert tours and make recordings, using modern reproductions of historical instruments and using singing and performing styles which musicologists believe were used during the era','\\nMedieval music includes liturgical music used for the church, and secular music, non-religious music; solely vocal music, such as Gregorian chant and choral music (music for a group of singers), solely instrumental music, and music that uses both voices and instruments (typically with the instruments accompanying the voices)',' Gregorian chant was sung by monks during Catholic Mass',' Prior to the development of musical notation, songs and pieces had to be learned \"by ear\", from one person who knew a song to another person','', \"Carnatic music, known as Karnāṭaka saṃgīta or Karnāṭaka saṅgītam in the South Indian languages, is a system of music commonly associated with South India, including the modern Indian states of Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Kerala and Tamil Nadu, and Sri Lanka',' The other subgenre being Hindustani music, which emerged as a distinct form because of Persian or Islamic influences from Northern India',' The main emphasis in Carnatic music is on vocal music; most compositions are written to be sung, and even when played on instruments, they are meant to be performed in gāyaki (singing) style',' The heptatonic scale of  Western musical notation is said to have its origins in Carnatic music, having been picked up by Pythagoras during his visit to India to learn mathematics, thus introducing it to the west',' Carnatic music is also usually taught and learned through compositions',' Telugu, Kannada and  Tamil predominates in the evolution of Carnatic Music as most compositions are in Telugu, Kannada, Tamil or Sanskrit','Carnatic music is usually performed by a small ensemble of musicians, consisting of a principal performer (usually a vocalist), a melodic accompaniment (usually a violin), a rhythm accompaniment (usually a mridangam), and a tambura, which acts as a drone throughout the performance',' Other typical instruments used in performances may include the ghatam, kanjira, morsing, venu flute, veena, and chitraveena',' The greatest concentration of Carnatic musicians is to be found in the city of Chennai',' Various Carnatic music festivals are held throughout India and abroad, including the Madras Music Season, which has been considered to be one of the world's largest cultural events',' It is used by listeners for yoga, massage, meditation, and reading as a method of stress management to bring about a state of ecstasy rather than trance, or to create a peaceful atmosphere in their home or other environments, and is associated with environmentalism and New Age spirituality',' Tony Scott\\'s Music for Zen Meditation (1964) is considered to be the first new-age recording',' Irv Teibel\\'s Environments series (1969–79) featured natural soundscapes, tintinnabulation, and \"Om\" chants and were some of the first publicly available psychoacoustic recordings','', 'Indian classical music is the classical music of the Indian subcontinent',' It has two major traditions: the North Indian classical music tradition is called Hindustani, while the South Indian expression is called Carnatic','The roots of the classical music of India are found in the Vedic literature of Hinduism and the ancient Natyashastra, the classic Sanskrit text on performance arts by Bharata Muni',' The 13th century Sanskrit text Sangita-Ratnakara of Sarangadeva is regarded as the definitive text by both the Hindustani music and the Carnatic music traditions','Indian classical music has two foundational elements, raga and tala','', 'An album is a collection of audio recordings issued as a collection on compact disc (CD), vinyl, audio tape, or another medium',' Albums of recorded sound were developed in the early 20th century as individual 78-rpm records collected in a bound book resembling a photograph album; this format evolved after 1948 into single vinyl LP records  played at 33+1⁄3 rpm','\\nMost albums are recorded in a studio, although they may also be recorded in a concert venue, at home, in the field, or a mix of places',' The time frame for completely recording an album varies between a few hours to several years',' This process usually requires several takes with different parts recorded separately, and then brought or \"mixed\" together',' Studios are built to absorb sound, eliminating reverberation, to assist in mixing different takes; other locations, such as concert venues and some \"live rooms\", have reverberation, which creates a \"live\" sound',' Recordings, including live, may contain editing, sound effects, voice adjustments, etc',' With modern recording technology, artists can be recorded in separate rooms or at separate times while listening to the other parts using headphones; with each part recorded as a separate track','\\nAlbum covers and liner notes are used, and sometimes additional information is provided, such as analysis of the recording, and lyrics or librettos',' Historically, the term \"album\" was applied to a collection of various items housed in a book format',' In musical usage the word was used for collections of short pieces of printed music from the early nineteenth century',' Later, collections of related 78rpm records were bundled in book-like albums (one side of a 78 rpm record could hold only about 3','5 minutes of sound)',' When long-playing records were introduced, a collection of pieces or songs on a single record was called an \"album\"; the word was extended to other recording media such as compact disc, MiniDisc, Compact audio cassette, 8-track tape and digital albums as they were introduced','', 'MusicBrainz is a project which aims to create a collaborative music database that is similar to the freedb project',' MusicBrainz was founded in response to the restrictions placed on the Compact Disc Database (CDDB),

artists, songwriters, etc',' Recorded works entries capture at a minimum the album title, track titles, and the length of each track',' Recorded works can also store information about the release date and country, the CD ID, cover art, acoustic fingerprint, free-form annotation text and other metadata','7 million artists, 2','6 million releases, and 23 million recordings',' End-users can use software that communicates with MusicBrainz to add metadata tags to their digital media files, such as ALAC, FLAC, MP3, Ogg Vorbis or AAC','\\nBackground music is commonly played where there is no audience at all, such as empty hallways and restrooms and fitting rooms',' It is also used in artificial space, such as music played while on hold during a telephone call, and virtual space, as in the ambient sounds or thematic music in massively multiplayer online role-playing games','', \"Dance music is music composed specifically to facilitate or accompany dancing',' It can be either a whole musical piece or part of a larger musical arrangement',' In terms of performance, the major categories are live dance music and recorded dance music',' While there exist attestations of the combination of dance and music in ancient times (for example Ancient Greek vases sometimes show dancers accompanied by musicians), the earliest Western dance music that we can still reproduce with a degree of certainty are old fashioned dances',' In the Baroque period, the major dance styles were noble court dances (see Baroque dance)',' In the classical music era, the minuet was frequently used as a third movement, although in this context it would not accompany any dancing','\\nModern popular dance music initially emerged from late 19th century's Western ballroom and social dance music',' In the 1930s, called the Swing era, Swing music was the popular dance music in America',' In the 1950s, rock and roll became the popular dance music',' This music, made using electronics, is a style

the classical music repertoire, which spans from the medieval era to the present, or popular music repertoire',' Most choirs are led by a conductor, who leads the performances with arm and face gestures','\\nA body of singers who perform together as a group is called a choir or chorus',' Choirs may sing without instrumental accompaniment, with the accompaniment of a piano or pipe organ, with a small ensemble (e','g',', harpsichord, cello and double bass for a Baroque piece), or with a full orchestra of 70 to 100 musicians','\\nThe term choir has the secondary definition of a subset of an ensemble; thus one speaks of the \"woodwind choir\" of an orchestra, or different \"choirs\" of voices or instruments in a polychoral composition',' In typical 18th- to 21st-century oratorios and masses, chorus or choir is usually understood to imply more than one singer per part, in contrast to the quartet of soloists also featured in these works','', \"The No Music (stylized as The No
