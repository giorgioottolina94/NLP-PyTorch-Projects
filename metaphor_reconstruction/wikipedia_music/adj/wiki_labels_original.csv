 Hip hop\'s early evolution occurred as sampling technology and drum machines became widely available and affordable,1

 Rapping developed as a vocal style in which the artist speaks or chants along rhythmically with an instrumental or synthesized beat,0

"\nIrish traditional music has endured more strongly against the forces of cinema, radio and the mass media than the indigenous folk music of most European countries",1
 This was possibly because the country was not a geographical battleground in either of the two World Wars,1
" Another potential factor was that the economy was largely agricultural, where oral tradition usually thrives",1
 From the end of the Second World War until the late fifties folk music was held in low regard,1
 Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann (an Irish traditional music association) and the popularity of the Fleadh Cheoil (music festival) helped lead the revival of the music,1
 The English Folk music scene also encouraged and gave self-confidence to many Irish musicians,1

 A characteristic Baroque form was the dance suite,1
" While the pieces in a dance suite were inspired by actual dance music, dance suites were designed purely for listening, not for accompanying dancers",1
"\nDuring the period, composers experimented with finding a fuller sound for each instrumental part (thus creating the orchestra), made changes in musical notation (the development of figured bass as a quick way to notate the chord progression of a song or piece), and developed new instrumental playing techniques",1

" Playing chamber music requires special skills, both musical and social, that differ from the skills required for playing solo or symphonic works",0
"Johann Wolfgang von Goethe described chamber music (specifically, string quartet music) as ""four rational people conversing""",1
" This conversational paradigm – which refers to the way one instrument introduces a melody or motif and then other instruments subsequently ""respond"" with a similar motif – has been a thread woven through the history of chamber music composition from the end of the 18th century to the present",1

" Consensus among music historians has been to start the era around 1400, with the end of the medieval era, and to close it around 1600, with the beginning of the Baroque period, therefore commencing the musical Renaissance about a hundred years after the beginning of the Renaissance as it is understood in other disciplines",1
"\nMusic was increasingly freed from medieval constraints, and more variety was permitted in range, rhythm, harmony, form, and notation",1
" On the other hand, rules of counterpoint became more constrained, particularly with regard to treatment of dissonances",1
" In the Renaissance, music became a vehicle for personal expression",1
 Composers found ways to make vocal music more expressive of the texts they were setting,1
" Secular music absorbed techniques from sacred music, and vice versa",1
  Popular secular forms such as the chanson and madrigal spread throughout Europe,1
" Courts employed virtuoso performers, both singers and instrumentalists",1
" Music also became more self-sufficient with its availability in printed form, existing for its own sake",1
"\nPrecursor versions of many familiar modern instruments (including the violin, guitar, lute and keyboard instruments) developed into new forms during the Renaissance",1
" These instruments were modified to respond to the evolution of musical ideas, and they presented new possibilities for composers and musicians to explore",1
" Early forms of modern woodwind and brass instruments like the bassoon and trombone also appeared, extending the range of sonic color and increasing the sound of instrumental ensembles",1
" During the 15th century, the sound of full triads became common, and towards the end of the 16th century the system of church modes began to break down entirely, giving way to functional tonality (the system in which songs and pieces are based on musical ""keys""), which would dominate Western art music for the next three centuries",1
"\nFrom the Renaissance era, notated secular and sacred music survives in quantity, including vocal and instrumental works and mixed vocal/instrumental works",0
"  A wide range of musical styles and genres flourished during the Renaissance, including masses, motets, madrigals, chansons, accompanied songs, instrumental dances, and many others",1

 Gregorian chant was sung by monks during Catholic Mass,0
" The Mass is a reenactment of Christ\'s Last Supper, intended to provide a spiritual connection between man and God",1
 Part of this connection was established through music,1
"During the Medieval period the foundation was laid for the music notation and music theory practices that would shape Western music into the norms that developed during the Common Practice period of shared music writing practices which encompassed the Baroque era (1600–1750), Classical era (1750–1820) and Romantic era (1800–1910)",1
 The most significant of these is the development of a comprehensive music notational system which enabled composers to write out their song melodies and instrumental pieces on parchment or paper,1
" Prior to the development of musical notation, songs and pieces had to be learned ""by ear"", from one person who knew a song to another person",0
 This greatly limited how many people could be taught new music and how wide music could spread to other regions or countries,1
 The development of music notation made it easier to disseminate (spread) songs and musical pieces to a larger number of people and to a wider geographic area,1

"Although there are stylistic differences, the basic elements of śruti (the relative musical pitch), swara (the musical sound of a single note), rāga (the mode or melodic formulæ), and tala (the rhythmic cycles) form the foundation of improvisation and composition in both Carnatic and Hindustani music",1
" Although improvisation plays an important role, Carnatic music is mainly sung through compositions, especially the kriti (or kirtanam) – a form developed between the 14th and 20th centuries by composers such as Purandara Dasa and the Trinity of Carnatic music",1
 Carnatic music is also usually taught and learned through compositions,0
" Telugu, Kannada and  Tamil predominates in the evolution of Carnatic Music as most compositions are in Telugu, Kannada, Tamil or Sanskrit",0
"Carnatic music is usually performed by a small ensemble of musicians, consisting of a principal performer (usually a vocalist), a melodic accompaniment (usually a violin), a rhythm accompaniment (usually a mridangam), and a tambura, which acts as a drone throughout the performance",0
