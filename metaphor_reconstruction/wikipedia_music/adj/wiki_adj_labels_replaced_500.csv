" By the late 1960s ""classic rock"" period, a number of distinct rock music subgenres had emerged, including hybrids like blues rock, folk rock, country rock, southern rock, raga rock, and jazz rock, many of which contributed to the development of psychedelic rock, which was influenced by the countercultural psychedelic and hippie scene",1

" Similarly, 1970s punk culture spawned the goth, punk, and emo subcultures",1
" Inheriting the folk tradition of the protest song, rock music has been associated with political activism as well as changes in social attitudes to race, sex, and drug use, and is often seen as an expression of youth revolt against adult consumerism and conformity",1

" The standards of sound quality (fidelity) and music production have evolved throughout the decades, meaning that some older examples of lo-fi may not have been originally recognized as such",1
" Lo-fi began to be recognized as a style of popular music in the 1990s, when it became alternately referred to as DIY music (from ""do it yourself"")",1
"Harmonic distortion and ""analog warmth"" are sometimes misleadingly suggested as core features of lo-fi music",1
" It is characterised by the inclusion of elements normally viewed as undesirable in professional contexts, such as misplayed notes, environmental interference, or phonographic imperfections (degraded audio signals, tape hiss, and so on)",1
"\nAlthough ""lo-fi"" has been in the cultural lexicon for approximately as long as ""high fidelity"", WFMU disc jockey William Berger is usually credited with popularizing the term in 1986",1
" At various points since the 1980s, ""lo-fi"" has been connected with cassette culture, the DIY ethos of punk, primitivism, outsider music, authenticity, slacker/Generation X stereotypes, and cultural nostalgia",1

" While often used to refer solely to rapping, ""hip hop"" more properly denotes the practice of the entire subculture",1
" The term hip hop music is sometimes used synonymously with the term rap music, though rapping is not a required component of hip hop music; the genre may also incorporate other elements of hip hop culture, including DJing, turntablism, scratching, beatboxing, and instrumental tracks",1
"Hip hop as both a musical genre and a culture was formed during the 1970s when block parties became increasingly popular in New York City, particularly among African American youth residing in the Bronx",1
Hip hop\'s early evolution occurred as sampling technology and drum machines became widely available and affordable,1
" Turntablist techniques such as scratching and beatmatching developed along with the breaks and Jamaican toasting, a chanting vocal style, was used over the beats",1
"\nHip hop music was not officially recorded for play on radio or television until 1979, largely due to poverty during the genre\'s birth and lack of acceptance outside ghetto neighborhoods",1
" Old school hip hop was the first mainstream wave of the genre, marked by its disco influence and party-oriented lyrics",1
The 1980s marked the diversification of hip hop as the genre developed more complex styles and spread around the world,1
" New school hip hop was the genre\'s second wave, marked by its electro sound, and led into Golden age hip hop, an innovative period between the mid-1980s and mid-1990s that also developed hip hop\'s own album era",1

" The United States also saw the success of regional styles such as crunk, a Southern genre that emphasized the beats and music more than the lyrics, and alternative hip hop began to secure a place in the mainstream, due in part to the crossover success of its artists",1
" During the late 2000s and early 2010s ""blog era"", rappers were able to build up a following through online methods of music distribution, such as social media and blogs, and mainstream hip hop took on a more melodic, sensitive direction following the commercial decline of gangsta rap",1

Adult contemporary is generally a continuation of the easy listening and soft rock style that became popular in the 1960s and 1970s with some adjustments that reflect the evolution of pop/rock music,1
"Adult contemporary tends to have lush, soothing and highly polished qualities where emphasis on melody and harmonies is accentuated",1
" It is usually melodic enough to get a listener\'s attention, and is inoffensive and pleasurable enough to work well as background music",1
" Like most of pop music, its songs tend to be written in a basic format employing a verse–chorus structure",1
" AC radio often targets the 25–44 age group, the demographic that has received the most attention from advertisers since the 1960s",1
A common practice in recent years of adult contemporary stations is to play less newer music and more hits of the past,1
This de-emphasis on new songs slows the progression of the AC chart,1
"Over the years, AC has spawned subgenres including ""hot AC"", ""soft AC"" (also known as ""lite AC""), ""urban AC"", ""rhythmic AC"", and ""Christian AC"" (a softer type of contemporary Christian music)",1
" Therefore, it is not usually considered a specific genre of music; it is merely an assemblage of selected tracks from musicians of many different genres",1
" It was rebranded as Big Hit Music by its parent company Hybe Corporation, formerly Big Hit Entertainment Co",1
" It was created by DJs and music producers from Chicago\'s underground club culture in the 1980s, as DJs from the subculture began altering disco songs to give them a more mechanical beat and deeper basslines",1
"The genre was pioneered by DJs and producers mainly from Chicago and New York such as Frankie Knuckles, Larry Levan, Ron Hardy, Jesse Saunders, Chip E",1
" From its beginnings in the Chicago club and local radio scene, the genre expanded internationally to London, then to other American cities such as New York City and Detroit before becoming a worldwide phenomenon",1

" It was originally used as a catch-all for the music that emerged after punk rock, including punk itself, but may be viewed retrospectively as a more accessible counterpart of post-punk",1
" Although new wave shared punk\'s DIY philosophy, the artists were more influenced by the lighter strains of 1960s pop while opposed to mainstream ""corporate"" rock, which they considered creatively stagnant, and the generally abrasive and political bents of punk rock",1
"Common characteristics of new wave music include a humorous or quirky pop approach, the use of electronic sounds, and a distinctive visual style featured in music videos and fashion",1
" In the early 1980s, virtually every new pop/rock act – and particularly those that featured synthesizers in their sound – was tagged as ""new wave""",1
" By the 2000s, critical consensus favored ""new wave"" to be an umbrella term that encompassed power pop, synth-pop, ska revival, and the softer strains of punk rock",1
New wave peaked commercially in the late 1970s and the early 1980s with numerous major artists and an abundance of one-hit wonders,1
" After MTV was launched in 1981, the network promoted new wave acts heavily on the channel, which gave the genre a boost in popularity",1

This was possibly because the country was not a geographical battleground in either of the two World Wars,1

" Structured vocal form in trance music forms the basis of the vocal trance subgenre, which has been described as ""grand, soaring, and operatic"" and ""ethereal female leads floating amongst the synths""",1

" In many instances, conventional use of melody, harmony, rhythm or pulse is dispensed with",1
"The Futurist art movement was important for the development of the noise aesthetic, as was the Dada art movement (a prime example being the Antisymphony concert performed on April 30, 1919 in Berlin), and later the Surrealist and Fluxus art movements, specifically the Fluxus artists Joe Jones, Yasunao Tone, George Brecht, Robert Watts, Wolf Vostell, Dieter Roth, Yoko Ono, Nam June Paik, Walter De Maria's Ocean Music, Milan Knížák's Broken Music Composition, early LaMonte Young and Takehisa Kosugi",1
