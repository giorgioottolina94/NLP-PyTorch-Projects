operation without detailed knowledge of their workings Systems (eg machines) applying technology by taking an input, changing it according to the system\\'s use, and then producing an outcome are referred to as technology systems or technological systems\\nThe simplest form of technology is the development and use of basic tools The prehistoric invention of shaped stone tools followed by the discovery of how to control fire increased sources of food The later Neolithic Revolution extended this, and quadrupled the sustenance available from a territory  The invention of the wheel helped humans to travel in and control their environment \\nDevelopments in historic times, including the printing press, the telephone, and the Internet, have lessened physical barriers to communication and allowed humans to interact freely on a global scale\\nTechnology has many effects It has helped develop more advanced economies (including today\\'s global economy) and has allowed the rise of a leisure class Many technological processes produce unwanted by-products known as pollution and deplete natural resources to the detriment of Earth\\'s environment Innovations have always influenced the values of a society and raised new questions in the ethics of technology Examples include the rise of the notion of efficiency in terms of human productivity, and the challenges of bioethics\\nPhilosophical debates have arisen over the use of technology, with disagreements over whether technology improves the human condition or worsens it Neo-Luddism, anarcho-primitivism, and similar reactionary movements criticize the pervasiveness of technology, arguing that it harms the environment and alienates people; proponents of ideologies such as transhumanism and techno-progressivism view continued technological progress as beneficial to society and the human condition', 'Seagate Technology Holdings plc, an Irish public limited company (commonly referred to as

stone tools to the complex genetic engineering and information technology that has emerged since the 1980s The term technology comes from the Greek word techne, meaning art and craft, and the word logos, meaning word and speech It was first used to describe applied arts, but it is now used to describe advancements and changes which affect the environment around usNew knowledge has enabled people to create new things, and conversely, many scientific endeavors are made possible by technologies which assist humans in traveling to places they could not previously reach, and by scientific instruments by which we study nature in more detail than our natural senses allow\\nSince much of technology is applied science, technical history is connected to the history of science Since technology uses resources, technical history is tightly connected to economic history From those resources, technology produces other resources, including technological artifacts used in everyday

generally an information system, a communications system, or, more specifically speaking, a computer system – including all hardware, software, and peripheral equipment – operated by a limited group of IT users\\nHumans have been storing, retrieving, manipulating, and communicating information since the Sumerians in Mesopotamia developed writing in about 3000 BC However, the term information technology in its modern sense first appeared in a 1958 article published in the Harvard Business Review; authors Harold J Leavitt and Thomas L Whisler commented that \"the new technology does not yet have a single established name We shall call it information technology (IT)\" Their definition consists of three categories: techniques for processing, the application of statistical and mathematical methods to decision-making, and the simulation of higher-order thinking through computer programsThe term is commonly used as a synonym for computers and computer networks, but it also encompasses other information distribution technologies such as television and telephones Several products or services within an economy are associated with information technology, including computer hardware, software, electronics, semiconductors, internet, telecom equipment, and e-commerceBased on the storage and processing technologies employed, it is possible to distinguish four distinct phases of IT

whose development, practical applications, or both are still largely unrealized, such that they are figuratively emerging into prominence from a background of nonexistence or obscurity These technologies are generally new but also include older technologies that are still relatively undeveloped in potential, such as gene therapy (which dates to circa 1990 but even today still has large undeveloped potential)  Emerging technologies are often perceived as capable of changing the status quo\\nEmerging technologies are characterized by radical novelty (in application even if not in origins), relatively fast growth, coherence, prominent impact, and uncertainty and ambiguity In other words, an emerging technology can be defined as \"a radically novel and relatively fast growing technology characterised by a certain degree of coherence persisting over time and with the potential to exert a considerable impact on the socio-economic domain(s) which is observed in terms of the composition of actors, institutions and patterns of interactions among those, along with the associated knowledge production processes Its most prominent impact, however, lies in the future and so in the emergence phase is still somewhat uncertain and ambiguous\"Emerging technologies include a variety of technologies such as educational technology, information technology, nanotechnology, biotechnology, cognitive science, robotics, and artificial intelligenceNew technological fields may result from the technological convergence of different systems evolving towards similar goals Convergence brings previously separate technologies such as voice (and telephony features), data (and productivity applications) and video together so that they share resources and interact with each other, creating new efficiencies \\nEmerging technologies are those technical innovations which represent progressive developments within a field for competitive advantage; converging technologies represent previously distinct fields which are in some way moving towards stronger inter-connection and similar goals However, the opinion on the degree of the impact, status and economic viability of several emerging and converging technologies varies', 'Nanotechnology, also shortened to nanotech, is the use of matter on an atomic, molecular, and supramolecular scale for industrial purposes The earliest, widespread description of nanotechnology referred to the particular technological goal of precisely manipulating atoms and molecules for fabrication of macroscale products, also now referred to as molecular nanotechnology A more generalized description of nanotechnology was subsequently established by the National Nanotechnology Initiative, which defined nanotechnology as the manipulation of matter with at least one dimension sized from 1 to 100 nanometers This definition reflects the fact that quantum mechanical effects are important at this quantum-realm scale, and so the definition shifted from a particular technological goal to a research category inclusive of all types of research and technologies that deal with the special properties of matter which occur below the given size threshold It is therefore common to see the plural form \"nanotechnologies\" as well as \"nanoscale technologies\" to refer to the broad range of research and applications whose common trait is size\\nNanotechnology as defined by size is naturally broad, including fields of science as diverse as surface science, organic chemistry, molecular biology, semiconductor physics, energy storage, engineering, microfabrication, and molecular engineering  The associated research and applications are equally diverse, ranging from extensions of conventional device physics to completely new approaches based upon molecular self-assembly, from developing new materials with dimensions on the nanoscale to direct control of matter on the atomic scale\\nScientists currently debate the future implications of nanotechnology Nanotechnology may be able to create many new materials and devices with a vast range of applications, such as in nanomedicine, nanoelectronics, biomaterials energy production, and consumer products On the other hand, nanotechnology raises many of the same issues as any new technology, including concerns about the toxicity and environmental impact of nanomaterials, and their potential effects on global economics, as well as speculation about various doomsday scenarios These concerns have led to a debate among advocacy groups and governments on whether special regulation of nanotechnology is warranted', 'ON Technology was a software company in the United States It was formed in 1987  by Mitch Kapor after his departure from Lotus Software  The original plan of the business was to build an object-oriented PC desktop environment providing a variety of applications  In (roughly) the early 1990s, the company was acquired by Notework Corporation, a vendor of LAN email systems The management of the merged company was the Notework Corporation management, but the company retained the ON Technology name (which management perceived had

electronic countermeasures, which covers a range of methods used to make personnel, aircraft, ships, submarines, missiles, satellites, and ground vehicles less visible (ideally invisible) to radar, infrared, sonar and other detection methods It corresponds to military camouflage for these parts of the electromagnetic spectrum (ie, multi-spectral camouflage)\\nDevelopment of modern stealth technologies in the United States began in 1958, where earlier attempts to prevent radar tracking of its U-2 spy planes during the Cold War by the Soviet Union had been unsuccessful Designers turned to developing a specific shape for planes that tended to reduce detection by redirecting electromagnetic radiation waves from radars Radiation-absorbent material was also tested and made to reduce or block radar signals that reflect off the surfaces of aircraft Such changes to shape and surface composition comprise stealth technology as currently used on the Northrop Grumman B-2 Spirit \"Stealth Bomber\"The concept of stealth is to operate or hide while giving enemy forces no indication as to the presence of friendly forces This concept was first explored through camouflage to make an object\\'s appearance blend into the visual background As the potency of detection and interception technologies (radar, infrared search and tracking, surface-to-air missiles, etc) have increased, so too has the extent to which the design and operation of military personnel and vehicles have been affected in response Some military uniforms are treated with chemicals to reduce their infrared signature A modern stealth vehicle is designed from the outset to have a chosen spectral signature The degree of stealth embodied in a given design is chosen according to the projected threats of detection', 'Regulatory technology, Abrv: regtech, is a new technology that uses information technology to enhance regulatory processes With its main application in the Financial sector, it is expanding into any regulated business with a particular appeal for the Consumer Goods Industry  Often regarded as a subcategory under FinTech, RegTech puts a particular emphasis on regulatory monitoring, reporting and compliance and is thus benefiting the finance industry The objective of RegTech is to enhance transparency as well as consistency and to standardize regulatory processes, to deliver sound interpretations of ambiguous regulations and thus to provide higher levels of quality at lower costRegTech to date has been focused on the digitization of manual reporting and compliance processes, for example in the context of Know your customer requirements This offers significant cost savings to the financial services industry and regulators However, a 2016 academic paper suggested that the potential of RegTech is far greater stating that \"it has the potential to enable a close to real-time and proportionate regulatory regime that identifies and addresses risk while also facilitating far more efficient regulatory compliance\"The report goes on to suggest that RegTech\\'s transformative potential will only be fully captured by a new and different regulatory framework situated at the nexus of data and digital identity The developments in FinTech, the tremendous changes in emerging markets, and the recent pro-active stance of regulators (for instance with the development of regulatory sandboxes), may potentially combine to facilitate a transition from one regulatory model to another', 'Tyler Technologies, Inc, based in Plano, Texas, is the largest provider
