", multi-spectral camouflage)"
"\nDevelopment of modern stealth technologies in the United States began in 1958, where earlier attempts to prevent radar tracking of its U-2 spy planes during the Cold War by the Soviet Union had been unsuccessful"
 Designers turned to developing a specific shape for planes that tended to reduce detection by redirecting electromagnetic radiation waves from radars
 Radiation-absorbent material was also tested and made to reduce or block radar signals that reflect off the surfaces of aircraft
" Such changes to shape and surface composition comprise stealth technology as currently used on the Northrop Grumman B-2 Spirit ""Stealth Bomber"""
The concept of stealth is to operate or hide while giving enemy forces no indication as to the presence of friendly forces
 This concept was first explored through camouflage to make an object\'s appearance blend into the visual background
" As the potency of detection and interception technologies (radar, infrared search and tracking, surface-to-air missiles, etc"
") have increased, so too has the extent to which the design and operation of military personnel and vehicles have been affected in response"

 Inkjet nozzles and inks were designed together and the inkjet performance was based on a design
" It was used as a data recorder in the early 1950s, later in the 1950s co-solvent-based inks in the publishing industry were seen for text and images, then solvent-based inks appeared in industrial marking on specialized surfaces and in the1990\'s phase change or hot-melt ink has become a popular with images and digital fabrication of electronic and mechanical devices, especially jewelry"
" Although the terms ""jetting"", ""inkjet technology"" and ""inkjet printing"", are commonly used interchangeably, inkjet printing usually refers to the publishing industry, used for printing graphical content, while industrial jetting usually refers to general purpose fabrication via material particle deposition"
 \n\nMany companies have worked with inkjet over the years
" Many, many patents have been issued and the technology has been used in a number of products"
" The basic form of the inkjet was a single nozzle with either fluid forced through under pressure, pulled from it by electrical potential or pushed out with the help of a piezo"
 Single nozzle inkjets will be discussed first in this introduction
" Inkjet technology was pioneered by Teletype Corporation in the 1960s which introduced the ""electronic pull"", high voltage drop extraction from a nozzle, Inktronic Teleprinter in 1965 printing at 120 characters per second (cps) from a row of 40 inkjets using the Charles R"

  The use of Hot-melt inks with a newer Drop-On-Demand inkjet technology(invented by Zoltan in 1972) with these inks would not be seen again until 1984 at Howtek and Exxon
Howtek was started as R
"H Research in 1982 by Robert Howard after successfully growing Centronics, the first dot-matrix solenoid-driven wire ribbon impact printer company in 1968"
 Howard calculated his solenoid matrix printer was 10-20 times faster than Teletype
 Howard had tested making dots on paper by using ultrasonic sound in the late 1960s but didn\'t advance the idea until some 20 years later in 1984 with Howtek when he hired 6 key employees from Exxon to develop his hot-melt color inkjet printer idea

" Patent records show a lengthy list of printing background employees at the EOS, Exxon Enterprises, Danbury Systems Division starting in 1978 including Ken Bower who was recruited by Exxon to found the engineering department at Exxon Enterprises"
" Ken\'s first job out of college in 1963 was at AT&T\'s Teletype, Division in Skokie, IL where his job was to transition an electro-mechanical stock exchange ticker (inkjet printer) into production"
 On his first day of work he smelled wax and was shown a 42 jet printer with heated printheads that was under development
" Ken went on to work at UARCO business forms and made associations with developers of On-Demand inkjet, including Steve Zoltan at Gould and Silonics under Ed Kyser and Stephen Sears"
 Steve Zoltan was using the cylindrical piezoelectric tube with cylindrical compression and Ed Keyser was using a flat piezoelectric diaphragm that squirted ink like an oil can
\n\nTwo employees hired at Exxon (EOS) with no experience in printing were James McMahon and Kathy Olson
" McMahon was hired to install the first Zoltan style single-nozzle inkjet, code name ""Alpha Jet"" to a fax printer and Olson was hired to build the ""Alpha"" jets for fax printer production"
 McMahon and Olson (married name McMahon) were two of the six employees hired by Robert Howard to design and build on-demand inkjets for the Pixelmaster color printer

 3D Inkjet single-nozzle printing has a direct path from Teletype hot-melt inks (Wax and metal alloy) to Steve Zoltan\'s single-nozzle jetting technology that never developed at Exxon with glass nozzles but became reality at Howtek with Teflon molded nozzles and heated printheads in 1984
" An ex-Howtek employee, Richard Helinski is credited for the patent using two materials to produce particle deposition articles in 3D using Howtek style inkjets and thermoplastic inks"
" These same Howtek inkjets and materials were used in the Ballistic Particle Manufacturing, Personal Modeler and the Visual Impact Corporation, Sculptor 3D printer businesses that have since closed"

"\nThe identification of the electron in 1897, along with the subsequent invention of the vacuum tube which could amplify and rectify small electrical signals,  inaugurated the field of electronics and the electron age"
" This distinction started around 1906 with the invention by Lee De Forest of the triode, which made electrical amplification of weak radio signals and audio signals possible with a non-mechanical device"
"  Until 1950, this field was called ""radio technology"" because its principal application was the design and theory of radio transmitters, receivers, and vacuum tubes"
"\nThe term ""solid-state electronics"" emerged after the first working transistor was invented by William Shockley, Walter Houser Brattain and John Bardeen at Bell Labs in 1947"
 The MOSFET (MOS  transistor) was later invented by Mohamed Atalla and Dawon Kahng at Bell Labs in 1959
" The MOSFET was the first truly compact transistor that could be miniaturised and mass-produced for a wide range of uses, revolutionizing the electronics industry, and playing a central role in the microelectronics revolution and Digital Revolution"
" The MOSFET has since become the basic element in most modern electronic equipment, and is the most widely used electronic device in the world"
"\nElectronics is widely used in information processing, telecommunication, and signal processing"
  The ability of electronic devices to act as switches makes digital information-processing possible
" Interconnection technologies such as circuit boards, electronics packaging technology, and other varied forms of communication infrastructure complete circuit functionality and transform the mixed electronic components into a regular working system, called an electronic system; examples are computers or control systems"
 An electronic system may be a component of another engineered system or a standalone device
 As of 2019 most electronic devices use semiconductor components to perform electron control
" Commonly, electronic devices contain circuitry consisting of active semiconductors supplemented with passive elements; such a circuit is described as an electronic circuit"
" Electronics deals with electrical circuits that involve active electrical components such as vacuum tubes, transistors, diodes, integrated circuits, optoelectronics, and sensors, associated passive electrical components, and interconnection technologies"
 The nonlinear behaviour of active components and their ability to control electron flows makes amplification of weak signals possible
\nThe study of semiconductor devices and related technology is considered a branch of solid-state electronics

"', ""In the broadest definition, a sensor is a device, module, machine, or subsystem whose purpose is to detect events or changes in its environment and send the information to other electronics, frequently a computer processor"
  A sensor is always used with other electronics
"\nSensors are used in everyday objects such as touch-sensitive elevator buttons (tactile sensor) and lamps which dim or brighten by touching the base, besides innumerable applications of which most people are never aware"
" With advances in micromachinery and easy-to-use microcontroller platforms, the uses of sensors have expanded beyond the traditional fields of temperature, pressure or flow measurement, for example into MARG sensors"
" Moreover, analog sensors such as potentiometers and force-sensing resistors are still widely used"
" Applications include manufacturing and machinery, airplanes and aerospace, cars, medicine, robotics and many other aspects of our day-to-day life"
" There are a wide range of other sensors, measuring chemical & physical properties of materials"
" A few examples include optical sensors for Refractive index measurement, vibrational sensors for fluid viscosity measurement and electro-chemical sensor for monitoring pH of fluids"
\nA sensor's sensitivity indicates how much the sensor's output changes when the input quantity being measured changes
" For instance, if the mercury in a thermometer moves 1  cm when the temperature changes by 1 °C, the sensitivity is 1 cm/°C (it is basically the slope dy/dx assuming a linear characteristic)"
" Some sensors can also affect what they measure; for instance, a room temperature thermometer inserted into a hot cup of liquid cools the liquid while the liquid heats the thermometer"
  Sensors are usually designed to have a small effect on what is measured; making the sensor smaller often improves this and may introduce other advantages
Technological progress allows more and more sensors to be manufactured on a microscopic scale as microsensors using MEMS technology
" In most cases, a microsensor reaches a significantly faster measurement time and higher sensitivity compared with macroscopic approaches"
" Due to the increasing demand for rapid, affordable and reliable information in today's world, disposable sensors—low-cost and easy‐to‐use devices for short‐term monitoring or single‐shot measurements—have recently gained growing importance"
" Using this class of sensors, critical analytical information can be obtained by anyone, anywhere and at any time, without the need for recalibration and worrying about contamination"

"', 'A blockchain is a growing list of records, called blocks, that are linked together using cryptography"
" Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data (generally represented as a Merkle tree)"
 The timestamp proves that the transaction data existed when the block was published in order to get into its hash
" As blocks each contain information about the block previous to it, they form a chain, with each additional block reinforcing the ones before it"
" Therefore, blockchains are resistant to modification of their data because once recorded, the data in any given block cannot be altered retroactively without altering all subsequent blocks"
"\nBlockchains are typically managed by a peer-to-peer network for use as a publicly distributed ledger, where nodes collectively adhere to a protocol to communicate and validate new blocks"
" Although blockchain records are not unalterable as forks are possible, blockchains may be considered secure by design and exemplify a distributed computing system with high Byzantine fault tolerance"
The blockchain was invented by a person (or group of people) using the name Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008 to serve as the public transaction ledger of the cryptocurrency bitcoin
 The identity of Satoshi Nakamoto remains unknown to date
 The invention of the blockchain for bitcoin made it the first digital currency to solve the double-spending problem without the need of a trusted authority or central server
 The bitcoin design has inspired other applications and blockchains that are readable by the public and are widely used by cryptocurrencies
 The blockchain is considered a type of payment rail
" Private blockchains have been proposed for business use but Computerworld called the marketing of such privatized blockchains without a proper security model ""snake oil"""
" However, others have argued that permissioned blockchains, if carefully designed, may be more decentralized and therefore more secure in practice than permissionless ones"
