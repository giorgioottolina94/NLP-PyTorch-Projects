" These technologies are generally new but also include older technologies that are still relatively undeveloped in potential, such as gene therapy (which dates to circa 1990 but even today still has large undeveloped potential)",1
Emerging technologies are often perceived as capable of changing the status quo,1
"\nEmerging technologies are characterized by radical novelty (in application even if not in origins), relatively fast growth, coherence, prominent impact, and uncertainty and ambiguity",1
" In other words, an emerging technology can be defined as ""a radically novel and relatively fast growing technology characterised by a certain degree of coherence persisting over time and with the potential to exert a considerable impact on the socio-economic domain(s) which is observed in terms of the composition of actors, institutions and patterns of interactions among those, along with the associated knowledge production processes",1

" The earliest, widespread description of nanotechnology referred to the particular technological goal of precisely manipulating atoms and molecules for fabrication of macroscale products, also now referred to as molecular nanotechnology",0
" A more generalized description of nanotechnology was subsequently established by the National Nanotechnology Initiative, which defined nanotechnology as the manipulation of matter with at least one dimension sized from 1 to 100 nanometers",0
" This definition reflects the fact that quantum mechanical effects are important at this quantum-realm scale, and so the definition shifted from a particular technological goal to a research category inclusive of all types of research and technologies that deal with the special properties of matter which occur below the given size threshold",1
" It is therefore common to see the plural form ""nanotechnologies"" as well as ""nanoscale technologies"" to refer to the broad range of research and applications whose common trait is size",1
"\nNanotechnology as defined by size is naturally broad, including fields of science as diverse as surface science, organic chemistry, molecular biology, semiconductor physics, energy storage, engineering, microfabrication, and molecular engineering",1
"  The associated research and applications are equally diverse, ranging from extensions of conventional device physics to completely new approaches based upon molecular self-assembly, from developing new materials with dimensions on the nanoscale to direct control of matter on the atomic scale",1
\nScientists currently debate the future implications of nanotechnology,1
" Nanotechnology may be able to create many new materials and devices with a vast range of applications, such as in nanomedicine, nanoelectronics, biomaterials energy production, and consumer products",0
" On the other hand, nanotechnology raises many of the same issues as any new technology, including concerns about the toxicity and environmental impact of nanomaterials, and their potential effects on global economics, as well as speculation about various doomsday scenarios",1
These concerns have led to a debate among advocacy groups and governments on whether special regulation of nanotechnology is warranted,1

"\nDevelopment of modern stealth technologies in the United States began in 1958, where earlier attempts to prevent radar tracking of its U-2 spy planes during the Cold War by the Soviet Union had been unsuccessful",1
Designers turned to developing a specific shape for planes that tended to reduce detection by redirecting electromagnetic radiation waves from radars,1
Radiation-absorbent material was also tested and made to reduce or block radar signals that reflect off the surfaces of aircraft,0
" Such changes to shape and surface composition comprise stealth technology as currently used on the Northrop Grumman B-2 Spirit ""Stealth Bomber""",0
The concept of stealth is to operate or hide while giving enemy forces no indication as to the presence of friendly forces,1
This concept was first explored through camouflage to make an object\'s appearance blend into the visual background,0
" As the potency of detection and interception technologies (radar, infrared search and tracking, surface-to-air missiles, etc",0
") have increased, so too has the extent to which the design and operation of military personnel and vehicles have been affected in response",1
Some military uniforms are treated with chemicals to reduce their infrared signature,0

" With its main application in the Financial sector, it is expanding into any regulated business with a particular appeal for the Consumer Goods Industry",1
"  Often regarded as a subcategory under FinTech, RegTech puts a particular emphasis on regulatory monitoring, reporting and compliance and is thus benefiting the finance industry",1
" The objective of RegTech is to enhance transparency as well as consistency and to standardize regulatory processes, to deliver sound interpretations of ambiguous regulations and thus to provide higher levels of quality at lower cost",1
"RegTech to date has been focused on the digitization of manual reporting and compliance processes, for example in the context of Know your customer requirements",1
This offers significant cost savings to the financial services industry and regulators,1
" However, a 2016 academic paper suggested that the potential of RegTech is far greater stating that ""it has the potential to enable a close to real-time and proportionate regulatory regime that identifies and addresses risk while also facilitating far more efficient regulatory compliance""",1
The report goes on to suggest that RegTech\'s transformative potential will only be fully captured by a new and different regulatory framework situated at the nexus of data and digital identity,1
" The developments in FinTech, the tremendous changes in emerging markets, and the recent pro-active stance of regulators (for instance with the development of regulatory sandboxes), may potentially combine to facilitate a transition from one regulatory model to another",1

" Today appropriate technology is often developed using open source principles, which have led to open-source appropriate technology (OSAT) and thus many of the plans of the technology can be freely found on the Internet",0
OSAT has been proposed as a new model of enabling innovation for sustainable development,1
Appropriate technology is most commonly discussed in its relationship to economic development and as an alternative to technology transfer of more capital-intensive technology from industrialized nations to developing countries,1
" However, appropriate technology movements can be found in both developing and developed countries",1
