" It uses active devices to control electron flow by amplification and rectification, which distinguishes it from  classical electrical engineering which uses passive effects such as resistance, capacitance and inductance to control current flow",0
\nElectronics has had a major effect on the development of modern society,1
"\nThe identification of the electron in 1897, along with the subsequent invention of the vacuum tube which could amplify and rectify small electrical signals,  inaugurated the field of electronics and the electron age",1
" This distinction started around 1906 with the invention by Lee De Forest of the triode, which made electrical amplification of weak radio signals and audio signals possible with a non-mechanical device",0
"  Until 1950, this field was called ""radio technology"" because its principal application was the design and theory of radio transmitters, receivers, and vacuum tubes",0
"\nThe term ""solid-state electronics"" emerged after the first working transistor was invented by William Shockley, Walter Houser Brattain and John Bardeen at Bell Labs in 1947",0
The MOSFET (MOS  transistor) was later invented by Mohamed Atalla and Dawon Kahng at Bell Labs in 1959,0
" The MOSFET was the first truly compact transistor that could be miniaturised and mass-produced for a wide range of uses, revolutionizing the electronics industry, and playing a central role in the microelectronics revolution and Digital Revolution",1
" The MOSFET has since become the basic element in most modern electronic equipment, and is the most widely used electronic device in the world",1

A sensor is always used with other electronics,0
"\nSensors are used in everyday objects such as touch-sensitive elevator buttons (tactile sensor) and lamps which dim or brighten by touching the base, besides innumerable applications of which most people are never aware",0
" With advances in micromachinery and easy-to-use microcontroller platforms, the uses of sensors have expanded beyond the traditional fields of temperature, pressure or flow measurement, for example into MARG sensors",1
" Moreover, analog sensors such as potentiometers and force-sensing resistors are still widely used",0
" Applications include manufacturing and machinery, airplanes and aerospace, cars, medicine, robotics and many other aspects of our day-to-day life",1
" There are a wide range of other sensors, measuring chemical & physical properties of materials",0
" A few examples include optical sensors for Refractive index measurement, vibrational sensors for fluid viscosity measurement and electro-chemical sensor for monitoring pH of fluids",0
\nA sensor's sensitivity indicates how much the sensor's output changes when the input quantity being measured changes,0
" For instance, if the mercury in a thermometer moves 1  cm when the temperature changes by 1 °C, the sensitivity is 1 cm/°C (it is basically the slope dy/dx assuming a linear characteristic)",0
" Some sensors can also affect what they measure; for instance, a room temperature thermometer inserted into a hot cup of liquid cools the liquid while the liquid heats the thermometer",0
Sensors are usually designed to have a small effect on what is measured; making the sensor smaller often improves this and may introduce other advantages,0
Technological progress allows more and more sensors to be manufactured on a microscopic scale as microsensors using MEMS technology,1
" In most cases, a microsensor reaches a significantly faster measurement time and higher sensitivity compared with macroscopic approaches",0
" Due to the increasing demand for rapid, affordable and reliable information in today's world, disposable sensors—low-cost and easy‐to‐use devices for short‐term monitoring or single‐shot measurements—have recently gained growing importance",1
