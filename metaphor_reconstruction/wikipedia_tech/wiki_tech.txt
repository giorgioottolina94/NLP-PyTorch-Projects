['Technology ("science of craft", from Greek τέχνη, techne, "art, skill, cunning of hand"; and -λογία, -logia) is the sum of techniques, skills, methods, and processes used in the production of goods or services or in the accomplishment of objectives, such as scientific investigation
 Technology can be the knowledge of techniques, processes, and the like, or it can be embedded in machines to allow for operation without detailed knowledge of their workings
 Systems (e
g
 machines) applying technology by taking an input, changing it according to the system\'s use, and then producing an outcome are referred to as technology systems or technological systems
\nThe simplest form of technology is the development and use of basic tools
 The prehistoric invention of shaped stone tools followed by the discovery of how to control fire increased sources of food
 The later Neolithic Revolution extended this, and quadrupled the sustenance available from a territory
  The invention of the wheel helped humans to travel in and control their environment
 \nDevelopments in historic times, including the printing press, the telephone, and the Internet, have lessened physical barriers to communication and allowed humans to interact freely on a global scale
\nTechnology has many effects
 It has helped develop more advanced economies (including today\'s global economy) and has allowed the rise of a leisure class
 Many technological processes produce unwanted by-products known as pollution and deplete natural resources to the detriment of Earth\'s environment
 Innovations have always influenced the values of a society and raised new questions in the ethics of technology
 Examples include the rise of the notion of efficiency in terms of human productivity, and the challenges of bioethics
\nPhilosophical debates have arisen over the use of technology, with disagreements over whether technology improves the human condition or worsens it
 Neo-Luddism, anarcho-primitivism, and similar reactionary movements criticize the pervasiveness of technology, arguing that it harms the environment and alienates people; proponents of ideologies such as transhumanism and techno-progressivism view continued technological progress as beneficial to society and the human condition

', "The history of technology is the history of the invention of tools and techniques and is one of the categories of world history
 Technology can refer to methods ranging from as simple as stone tools to the complex genetic engineering and information technology that has emerged since the 1980s
 The term technology comes from the Greek word techne, meaning art and craft, and the word logos, meaning word and speech
 It was first used to describe applied arts, but it is now used to describe advancements and changes which affect the environment around us
New knowledge has enabled people to create new things, and conversely, many scientific endeavors are made possible by technologies which assist humans in traveling to places they could not previously reach, and by scientific instruments by which we study nature in more detail than our natural senses allow
\nSince much of technology is applied science, technical history is connected to the history of science
 Since technology uses resources, technical history is tightly connected to economic history
 From those resources, technology produces other resources, including technological artifacts used in everyday life
\nTechnological change affects, and is affected by, a society's cultural traditions
 It is a force for economic growth and a means to develop and project economic, political, military power and wealth
", 'Information technology (IT) is the use of computers to create, process, store and exchange all kinds of electronic data and information
 IT is typically used within the context of business operations as opposed to personal or entertainment technologies
 IT is considered to be a subset of information and communications technology (ICT)
 An information technology system (IT system) is generally an information system, a communications system, or, more specifically speaking, a computer system – including all hardware, software, and peripheral equipment – operated by a limited group of IT users
\nHumans have been storing, retrieving, manipulating, and communicating information since the Sumerians in Mesopotamia developed writing in about 3000 BC
 However, the term information technology in its modern sense first appeared in a 1958 article published in the Harvard Business Review; authors Harold J
 Leavitt and Thomas L
 Whisler commented that "the new technology does not yet have a single established name
 We shall call it information technology (IT)
" Their definition consists of three categories: techniques for processing, the application of statistical and mathematical methods to decision-making, and the simulation of higher-order thinking through computer programs
The term is commonly used as a synonym for computers and computer networks, but it also encompasses other information distribution technologies such as television and telephones
 Several products or services within an economy are associated with information technology, including computer hardware, software, electronics, semiconductors, internet, telecom equipment, and e-commerce
Based on the storage and processing technologies employed, it is possible to distinguish four distinct phases of IT development: pre-mechanical (3000 BC – 1450 AD), mechanical (1450–1840), electromechanical (1840–1940), and electronic (1940–present)
 This article focuses on the most recent period (electronic)

', 'A technology roadmap is a flexible planning technique to support strategic and long-range planning, by matching short-term and long-term goals with specific technology solutions
 It is a plan that applies to a new product or process and may include using technology forecasting or technology scouting to identify suitable emerging technologies
 It is a known technique to help manage the fuzzy front-end of innovation
 It is also expected that roadmapping techniques may help companies to survive in turbulent environments and help them to plan in a more holistic way to include non-financial goals and drive towards a more sustainable development
 Here roadmaps can be combined with other corporate foresight methods to facilitate systemic change
Developing a roadmap has three major uses
 It helps reach a consensus about a set of needs and the technologies required to satisfy those needs, it provides a mechanism to help forecast technology developments, and it provides a framework to help plan and coordinate technology developments
 It may also be used as an analysis tool to map the development and emergence from new industries

', 'Emerging technologies are technologies whose development, practical applications, or both are still largely unrealized, such that they are figuratively emerging into prominence from a background of nonexistence or obscurity
 These technologies are generally new but also include older technologies that are still relatively undeveloped in potential, such as gene therapy (which dates to circa 1990 but even today still has large undeveloped potential)
  Emerging technologies are often perceived as capable of changing the status quo
\nEmerging technologies are characterized by radical novelty (in application even if not in origins), relatively fast growth, coherence, prominent impact, and uncertainty and ambiguity
 In other words, an emerging technology can be defined as "a radically novel and relatively fast growing technology characterised by a certain degree of coherence persisting over time and with the potential to exert a considerable impact on the socio-economic domain(s) which is observed in terms of the composition of actors, institutions and patterns of interactions among those, along with the associated knowledge production processes
 Its most prominent impact, however, lies in the future and so in the emergence phase is still somewhat uncertain and ambiguous
"Emerging technologies include a variety of technologies such as educational technology, information technology, nanotechnology, biotechnology, cognitive science, robotics, and artificial intelligence
New technological fields may result from the technological convergence of different systems evolving towards similar goals
 Convergence brings previously separate technologies such as voice (and telephony features), data (and productivity applications) and video together so that they share resources and interact with each other, creating new efficiencies
 \nEmerging technologies are those technical innovations which represent progressive developments within a field for competitive advantage; converging technologies represent previously distinct fields which are in some way moving towards stronger inter-connection and similar goals
 However, the opinion on the degree of the impact, status and economic viability of several emerging and converging technologies varies
', 'Nanotechnology, also shortened to nanotech, is the use of matter on an atomic, molecular, and supramolecular scale for industrial purposes
 The earliest, widespread description of nanotechnology referred to the particular technological goal of precisely manipulating atoms and molecules for fabrication of macroscale products, also now referred to as molecular nanotechnology
 A more generalized description of nanotechnology was subsequently established by the National Nanotechnology Initiative, which defined nanotechnology as the manipulation of matter with at least one dimension sized from 1 to 100 nanometers
 This definition reflects the fact that quantum mechanical effects are important at this quantum-realm scale, and so the definition shifted from a particular technological goal to a research category inclusive of all types of research and technologies that deal with the special properties of matter which occur below the given size threshold
 It is therefore common to see the plural form "nanotechnologies" as well as "nanoscale technologies" to refer to the broad range of research and applications whose common trait is size
\nNanotechnology as defined by size is naturally broad, including fields of science as diverse as surface science, organic chemistry, molecular biology, semiconductor physics, energy storage, engineering, microfabrication, and molecular engineering
  The associated research and applications are equally diverse, ranging from extensions of conventional device physics to completely new approaches based upon molecular self-assembly, from developing new materials with dimensions on the nanoscale to direct control of matter on the atomic scale
\nScientists currently debate the future implications of nanotechnology
 Nanotechnology may be able to create many new materials and devices with a vast range of applications, such as in nanomedicine, nanoelectronics, biomaterials energy production, and consumer products
 On the other hand, nanotechnology raises many of the same issues as any new technology, including concerns about the toxicity and environmental impact of nanomaterials, and their potential effects on global economics, as well as speculation about various doomsday scenarios
 These concerns have led to a debate among advocacy groups and governments on whether special regulation of nanotechnology is warranted
', 'ON Technology was a software company in the United States
 It was formed in 1987  by Mitch Kapor after his departure from Lotus Software
  The original plan of the business was to build an object-oriented PC desktop environment providing a variety of applications

 The management of the merged company was the Notework Corporation management, but the company retained the ON Technology name (which management perceived had more cache/brand
)Subsequently, ON Technology performed a series of small product/company acquisitions to grow its product line, including additional email software (DaVinci, a message handling system-based email product), anti-virus technology, (corporate) Internet usage monitoring, IP firewall, and desktop systems management
The company went public in (approximately) 1995, providing an additional structural method to perform most of the acquisitions providing the products listed above
\nThe company was unique in its go-to-market model, using a 30-day free trial model coupled with significant marketing and telesales to reach a large number of small- to medium-sized customers
\nIn 1998, the company restructured its operations and sold off its "free-trial" small/medium business products to Elron Software
 It retained "enterprise-sized" products (the MeetingMaker calendaring product and the ON Command CCM desktop systems management product) which it sold using a more traditional enterprise software business model
ON spun out the Meeting Maker product in a private transaction to a private investor, who eventually sold the technology to PeopleCube
 The only remaining technology at this point was the systems management software, branded "CCM" at that time

", 'Stealth technology, also termed low observable technology (LO technology), is a sub-discipline of military tactics and passive and active electronic countermeasures, which covers a range of methods used to make personnel, aircraft, ships, submarines, missiles, satellites, and ground vehicles less visible (ideally invisible) to radar, infrared, sonar and other detection methods
 It corresponds to military camouflage for these parts of the electromagnetic spectrum (i
e
, multi-spectral camouflage)
\nDevelopment of modern stealth technologies in the United States began in 1958, where earlier attempts to prevent radar tracking of its U-2 spy planes during the Cold War by the Soviet Union had been unsuccessful
 Designers turned to developing a specific shape for planes that tended to reduce detection by redirecting electromagnetic radiation waves from radars
 Radiation-absorbent material was also tested and made to reduce or block radar signals that reflect off the surfaces of aircraft
 Such changes to shape and surface composition comprise stealth technology as currently used on the Northrop Grumman B-2 Spirit "Stealth Bomber"
The concept of stealth is to operate or hide while giving enemy forces no indication as to the presence of friendly forces
 This concept was first explored through camouflage to make an object\'s appearance blend into the visual background
 As the potency of detection and interception technologies (radar, infrared search and tracking, surface-to-air missiles, etc
) have increased, so too has the extent to which the design and operation of military personnel and vehicles have been affected in response
 Some military uniforms are treated with chemicals to reduce their infrared signature
 A modern stealth vehicle is designed from the outset to have a chosen spectral signature
 The degree of stealth embodied in a given design is chosen according to the projected threats of detection
', 'Regulatory technology, Abrv: regtech, is a new technology that uses information technology to enhance regulatory processes
 With its main application in the Financial sector, it is expanding into any regulated business with a particular appeal for the Consumer Goods Industry
  Often regarded as a subcategory under FinTech, RegTech puts a particular emphasis on regulatory monitoring, reporting and compliance and is thus benefiting the finance industry
 The objective of RegTech is to enhance transparency as well as consistency and to standardize regulatory processes, to deliver sound interpretations of ambiguous regulations and thus to provide higher levels of quality at lower cost
RegTech to date has been focused on the digitization of manual reporting and compliance processes, for example in the context of Know your customer requirements
 This offers significant cost savings to the financial services industry and regulators
 However, a 2016 academic paper suggested that the potential of RegTech is far greater stating that "it has the potential to enable a close to real-time and proportionate regulatory regime that identifies and addresses risk while also facilitating far more efficient regulatory compliance"
The report goes on to suggest that RegTech\'s transformative potential will only be fully captured by a new and different regulatory framework situated at the nexus of data and digital identity
 The developments in FinTech, the tremendous changes in emerging markets, and the recent pro-active stance of regulators (for instance with the development of regulatory sandboxes), may potentially combine to facilitate a transition from one regulatory model to another

 It was originally articulated as intermediate technology by the economist Ernst Friedrich "Fritz" Schumacher in his work Small Is Beautiful
 Both Schumacher and many modern-day proponents of appropriate technology also emphasize the technology as people-centered
Appropriate technology has been used to address issues in a wide range of fields
 Well-known examples of appropriate technology applications include: bike- and hand-powered water pumps (and other self-powered equipment), the universal nut sheller, self-contained solar lamps and streetlights, and passive solar building designs
 Today appropriate technology is often developed using open source principles, which have led to open-source appropriate technology (OSAT) and thus many of the plans of the technology can be freely found on the Internet
 OSAT has been proposed as a new model of enabling innovation for sustainable development
Appropriate technology is most commonly discussed in its relationship to economic development and as an alternative to technology transfer of more capital-intensive technology from industrialized nations to developing countries
 However, appropriate technology movements can be found in both developing and developed countries
 In developed countries, the appropriate technology movement grew out of the energy crisis of the 1970s and focuses mainly on environmental and sustainability issues
 Today the idea is multifaceted; in some contexts, appropriate technology can be described as the simplest level of technology that can achieve the intended purpose, whereas in others, it can refer to engineering that takes adequate consideration of social and environmental ramifications
 The facets are connected through robustness and sustainable living

', 'In strategy games, a technology, tech, or research tree is a hierarchical visual representation of the possible sequences of upgrades a player can take (most often through the act of research)
 Because these trees are technically directed and acyclic, they can more accurately be described as a technology directed acyclic graph
 The diagram is tree-shaped in the sense that it branches between each \'level\', allowing the player to choose one sequence or another
 Each level is called a tier and is often used to describe the technological strength of a player
 Typically, at the beginning of a session of a strategy game, a player will start at tier 1, and will only have a few options for technologies to research
 Each technology that a player researches will open up one or more new options, but may or may not, depending on the computer game, close off the paths to other options
 The tech tree is the representation of all possible paths of research a player can take, up to the culmination of said sequence
\nA player who is engaged in research activities is said to be "teching up", "going up the tech tree", or "moving up the tech tree"
 Analysis of a tech tree can lead players to memorize and use specific build orders
