the nations.',With a shout exclaimed the people,',Henceforth he shall be the West-Wind,',And hereafter and forever',Shall he hold supreme dominion',Over all the winds of heaven.',Call him no more Mudjekeewis,',Thus was Mudjekeewis chosen',For himself he kept the West-Wind,',Gave the others to his children;',Unto Wabun gave the East-Wind,',And the North-Wind, wild and cruel,',To the fierce Kabibonokka.',Young and beautiful was Wabun;',He it was who brought the morning,',He it was whose silver arrows',Chased the dark o'er hill and valley;',He it was whose cheeks were painted',With the brightest streaks of crimson,',And whose voice awoke the village,',Called the deer, and called the hunter.',Though the birds sang gayly to him,',Though the wild-flowers of the meadow',Filled the air with odors for him;',Though the forests and the rivers',Sang and shouted at his coming,',Still his heart was sad within him,',For he was alone in heaven.',But one morning, gazing earthward,',While the village still was sleeping,',And the fog lay on the river,',Like a ghost, that goes at sunrise,',He beheld a maiden walking',All alone upon a meadow,',Gathering water-flags and rushes',By a river in the meadow.',Every morning, gazing earthward,',Still the first thing he beheld there',Was her blue eyes looking at him,',Two blue lakes among the rushes.',And he loved the lonely maiden,',Who thus waited for his coming;',For they both were solitary,',She on earth and he in heaven.',And he wooed her with caresses,',Wooed her with his smile of sunshine,',With his flattering words he wooed her,',With his sighing and his singing,',Gentlest whispers in the branches,',Softest music, sweetest odors,',Till he drew her to his bosom,',Folded in his robes of crimson,',Till into a star he changed her,',Trembling still upon his bosom;',And forever in the heavens',They are seen together walking,',But the fierce Kabibonokka',Had his dwelling among icebergs,',In the everlasting snow-drifts,',In the kingdom of Wabasso,',In the land of the White Rabbit.',He it was whose hand in Autumn',Painted all the trees with scarlet,',Stained the leaves with red and yellow;',He it was who sent the snow-flake,',Sifting, hissing through the forest,',Froze the ponds, the lakes, the rivers,',Drove the loon and sea-gull southward,',Drove the cormorant and curlew',To their nests of sedge and sea-tang',In the realms of Shawondasee.',Once the fierce Kabibonokka',Issued from his lodge of snow-drifts',From his home among the icebergs,',And his hair, with snow besprinkled,',Streamed behind him like a river,',Like a black and wintry river,',As he howled and hurried southward,',Over frozen lakes and moorlands.',There among the reeds and rushes',Found he Shingebis, the diver,',Trailing strings of fish behind him,',O'er the frozen fens and moorlands,',Lingering still among the moorlands,',Though his tribe had long departed',To the land of Shawondasee.',Cried the fierce Kabibonokka,',\"Who is this that dares to brave me?',Dares to stay in my dominions,',When the Wawa has departed,',When the wild-goose has gone southward,',And the heron, the Shuh-shuh-gah,',Long ago departed southward?',I will go into his wigwam,',I will put his smouldering fire out!\"',And at night Kabibonokka,',To the lodge came wild and wailing,',Heaped the snow in drifts about it,',Shouted down into the smoke-flue,',Shook the lodge-poles in his fury,',Flapped the curtain of the door-way.',Shingebis, the diver, feared not,',Shingebis, the diver, cared not;',Four great logs had he for firewood,',One for each moon of the winter,',And for food the fishes served him.',By his blazing fire he sat there,',Warm and merry, eating, laughing,',You are but my fellow-mortal!\"',Then Kabibonokka entered,',And though Shingebis, the diver,',Felt his presence by the coldness,',Felt his icy breath upon him,',Still he did not cease his singing,',Still he did not leave his laughing,',Only turned the log a little,',Only made the fire burn brighter,',Made the sparks fly up the smoke-flue.',From Kabibonokka's forehead,',From his snow-besprinkled tresses,',Drops of sweat fell fast and heavy,',Making dints upon the ashes,',As along the eaves of lodges,',As from drooping boughs of hemlock,',Drips the melting snow in spring-time,',Making hollows in the snow-drifts.',Till at last he rose defeated,',Could not bear the heat and laughter,',Could not bear the merry singing,',But rushed headlong through the door-way,',Stamped upon the crusted snow-drifts,',Stamped upon the lakes and rivers,',Made the snow upon them harder,',Made the ice upon them thicker,',Challenged Shingebis, the diver,',To come forth and wrestle with him,',To come forth and wrestle naked',On the frozen fens and moorlands.',Forth went Shingebis, the diver,',Wrestled all night with the North-Wind,',Wrestled naked on the moorlands',With the fierce Kabibonokka,',Till his panting breath grew fainter,',Till his frozen grasp grew feebler,',Till he reeled and staggered backward,',And retreated, baffled, beaten,',To the kingdom of Wabasso,',To the land of the White Rabbit,',Hearing still the gusty laughter,',Hearing Shingebis, the diver,',You are but my fellow-mortal!\"',Shawondasee, fat and lazy,',Had his dwelling far to southward,',In the drowsy, dreamy sunshine,',In the never-ending Summer.',He it was who sent the wood-birds,',Sent the robin, the Opechee,',Sent the bluebird, the Owaissa,',Sent the Shawshaw, sent the swallow,',Sent the wild-goose, Wawa, northward,',Sent the melons and tobacco,',And the grapes in purple clusters.',From his pipe the smoke ascending',Filled the sky with haze and vapor,',Filled the air with dreamy softness,',Gave a twinkle to the water,',Touched the rugged hills with smoothness,',Brought the tender Indian Summer',To the melancholy north-land,',In the dreary Moon of Snow-shoes.',Listless, careless Shawondasee!',In his life he had one shadow,',In his heart one sorrow had he.',Once, as he was gazing northward,',Far away upon a prairie',He beheld a maiden standing,',Saw a tall and slender maiden',All alone upon a prairie;',Brightest green were all her garments,',And her hair was like the sunshine.',Day by day he gazed upon her,',Day by day he sighed with passion,',Day by day his heart within him',Grew more hot with love and longing',For the maid with yellow tresses.',But he was too fat and lazy',To bestir himself and woo her.',Yes, too indolent and easy',To pursue her and persuade her;',So he only gazed upon her,',Only sat and sighed with passion',For the maiden of the prairie.',Till one morning, looking northward,',He beheld her yellow tresses',Changed and covered o'er with whiteness,',Covered as with whitest snow-flakes.',\"Ah! my brother from the North-land,',From the kingdom of Wabasso,',From the land of the White Rabbit!',You have stolen the maiden from me,',You have laid your hand upon her,',You have wooed and won my maiden,',With your stories of the North-land!\"',Thus the wretched Shawondasee',Breathed into the air his sorrow;',And the South-Wind o'er the prairie',Wandered warm with sighs of passion,',With the sighs of Shawondasee,',Till the air seemed full of snow-flakes,',Full of thistle-down the prairie,',And the maid with hair like sunshine',Vanished from his sight forever;',Never more did Shawondasee',See the maid with yellow tresses!',Poor, deluded Shawondasee!','T was no woman that you gazed at,','T was no maiden that you sighed for,','T was the prairie dandelion',That through all the dreamy Summer',You had gazed at with such longing,',You had sighed for with such passion,',And had puffed away forever,',Blown into the air with sighing.',Ah! deluded Shawondasee!',Thus the Four Winds were divided',Thus the sons of Mudjekeewis',Had their stations in the heavens,',At the corners of the heavens;',For himself the West-Wind only',Kept the mighty Mudjekeewis.',Hiawatha's Childhood',Downward through the evening twilight,',In the days that are forgotten,',In the unremembered ages,',From the full moon fell Nokomis,',Fell the beautiful Nokomis,',She a wife, but not a mother.',She was sporting with her women,',Swinging in a swing of grape-vines,',When her rival the rejected,',Full of jealousy and hatred,',Cut the leafy swing asunder,',Cut in twain the twisted grape-vines,',And Nokomis fell affrighted',Downward through the evening twilight,',On the Muskoday, the meadow,',On the prairie full of blossoms.',\"See! a star falls!\" said the people;',\"From the sky a star is falling!\"',There among the ferns and mosses,',There among the prairie lilies,',On the Muskoday, the meadow,',In the moonlight and the starlight,',Fair Nokomis bore a daughter.',And she called her name Wenonah,',As the first-born of her daughters.',And the daughter of Nokomis',Grew up like the prairie lilies,',Grew a tall and slender maiden,',With the beauty of the moonlight,',With the beauty of the starlight.',And Nokomis warned her often,',Saying oft, and oft repeating,',\"Oh, beware of Mudjekeewis,',Listen not to what he tells you;',Lie not down upon the meadow,',Stoop not down among the lilies,',Lest the West-Wind come and harm you!\"',But she heeded not the warning,',Heeded not those words of wisdom,',And the West-Wind came at evening,',Walking lightly o'er the prairie,',Whispering to the leaves and blossoms,',Bending low the flowers and grasses,',Found the beautiful Wenonah,',Lying there among the lilies,',Wooed her with his words of sweetness,',Wooed her with his soft caresses,',Till she bore a son in sorrow,',Bore a son of love and sorrow.',Thus was born my Hiawatha,',Thus was born the child of wonder;',But the daughter of Nokomis,',Hiawatha's gentle mother,',In her anguish died deserted',By the West-Wind, false and faithless,',By the heartless Mudjekeewis.',For her daughter long and loudly',Wailed and wept the sad Nokomis;',\"Oh that I were dead!\" she murmured,',\"Oh that I were dead, as thou art!',No more work, and no more weeping,',By the shores of Gitche Gumee,',By the shining Big-Sea-Water,',Stood the wigwam of Nokomis,',Dark behind it rose the forest,',Rose the black and gloomy pine-trees,',Rose the firs with cones upon them;',Bright before it beat the water,',Beat the clear and sunny water,',Beat the shining Big-Sea-Water.',There the wrinkled old Nokomis',Nursed the little Hiawatha,',Rocked him in his linden cradle,',Bedded soft in moss and rushes,',Safely bound with reindeer sinews;',Stilled his fretful wail by saying,',\"Hush! the Naked Bear will hear thee!\"',Lulled him into slumber, singing,',\"Ewa-yea! my little owlet!',Who is this, that lights the wigwam?',With his great eyes lights the wigwam?',Ewa-yea! my little owlet!\"',Many things Nokomis taught him',Of the stars that shine in heaven;',Showed him Ishkoodah, the comet,',Ishkoodah, with fiery tresses;',Showed the Death-Dance of the spirits,',Warriors with their plumes and war-clubs,',Flaring far away to northward',In the frosty nights of Winter;',Showed the broad white road in heaven,',Pathway of the ghosts, the shadows,',Running straight across the heavens,',Crowded with the ghosts, the shadows.',At the door on summer evenings',Sat the little Hiawatha;',Heard the whispering of the pine-trees,',Heard the lapping of the waters,',Sounds of music, words of wonder;',\"Minne-wawa!\" said the Pine-trees,',\"Mudway-aushka!\" said the water.',Saw the fire-fly, Wah-wah-taysee,',Flitting through the dusk of evening,',With the twinkle of its candle',Lighting up the brakes and bushes,',And he sang the song of children,',Sang the song Nokomis taught him:',\"Wah-wah-taysee, little fire-fly,',Little, flitting, white-fire insect,',Little, dancing, white-fire creature,',Light me with your little candle,',Ere upon my bed I lay me,',Ere in sleep I close my eyelids!\"',Saw the moon rise from the water',Rippling, rounding from the water,',Saw the flecks and shadows on it,',Whispered, \"What is that, Nokomis?\"',And the good Nokomis answered:',\"Once a warrior, very angry,',Seized his grandmother, and threw her',Up into the sky at midnight;',Right against the moon he threw her;','T is her body that you see there.\"',Saw the rainbow in the heaven,',In the eastern sky, the rainbow,',Whispered, \"What is that, Nokomis?\"',And the good Nokomis answered:',\"'T is the heaven of flowers you see there;',All the wild-flowers of the forest,',All the lilies of the prairie,',When on earth they fade and perish,',Blossom in that heaven above us.\"',When he heard the owls at midnight,',Hooting, laughing in the forest,',\"What is that?\" he cried in terror,',\"What is that,\" he said, \"Nokomis?\"',And the good Nokomis answered:',\"That is but the owl and owlet,',Talking in their native language,',Talking, scolding at each other.\"',Then the little Hiawatha',Learned of every bird its language,',Learned their names and all their secrets,',How they built their nests in Summer,',Where they hid themselves in Winter,',Talked with them whene'er he met them,',Called them \"Hiawatha's Chickens.\"',Of all beasts he learned the language,',Learned their names and all their secrets,',How the beavers built their lodges,',Where the squirrels hid their acorns,',How the reindeer ran so swiftly,',Why the rabbit was so timid,',Talked with them whene'er he met them,',Called them \"Hiawatha's Brothers.\"',Then Iagoo, the great boaster,',He the marvellous story-teller,',He the traveller and the talker,',He the friend of old Nokomis,',From a branch of ash he made it,',From an oak-bough made the arrows,',Tipped with flint, and winged with feathers,',And the cord he made of deer-skin.',Then he said to Hiawatha:',\"Go, my son, into the forest,',Where the red deer herd together,',Kill for us a famous roebuck,',Kill for us a deer with antlers!\"',Forth into the forest straightway',All alone walked Hiawatha',Proudly, with his bow and arrows;',And the birds sang round him, o'er him,',\"Do not shoot us, Hiawatha!\"',Sang the robin, the Opechee,',Sang the bluebird, the Owaissa,',\"Do not shoot us, Hiawatha!\"',Up the oak-tree, close beside him,',Sprang the squirrel, Adjidaumo,',In and out among the branches,',Coughed and chattered from the oak-tree,',Laughed, and said between his laughing,',\"Do not shoot me, Hiawatha!\"',And the rabbit from his pathway',Leaped aside, and at a distance',Sat erect upon his haunches,',Half in fear and half in frolic,',Saying to the little hunter,',\"Do not shoot me, Hiawatha!\"',But he heeded not, nor heard them,',For his thoughts were with the red deer;',On their tracks his eyes were fastened,',Leading downward to the river,',To the ford across the river,',And as one in slumber walked he.',Hidden in the alder-bushes,',There he waited till the deer came,',Till he saw two antlers lifted,',Saw two eyes look from the thicket,',Saw two nostrils point to windward,',And a deer came down the pathway,',Flecked with leafy light and shadow.',And his heart within him fluttered,',Trembled like the leaves above him,',Like the birch-leaf palpitated,',As the deer came down the pathway.',Then, upon one knee uprising,',Hiawatha aimed an arrow;',Scarce a twig moved with his motion,',Scarce a leaf was stirred or rustled,',But the wary roebuck started,',Stamped with all his hoofs together,',Listened with one foot uplifted,',Leaped as if to meet the arrow;',Ah! the singing, fatal arrow,',Like a wasp it buzzed and stung him!',Dead he lay there in the forest,',By the ford across the river;',Beat his timid heart no longer,',But the heart of Hiawatha',Throbbed and shouted and exulted,',As he bore the red deer homeward,',Hailed his coming with applauses.',From the red deer's hide Nokomis',Made a cloak for Hiawatha,',From the red deer's flesh Nokomis',Made a banquet to his honor.',All the village came and feasted,',All the guests praised Hiawatha,',Called him Strong-Heart, Soan-ge-taha!',Called him Loon-Heart, Mahn-go-taysee!',Out of childhood into manhood',Now had grown my Hiawatha,',Skilled in all the craft of hunters,',Learned in all the lore of old men,',In all youthful sports and pastimes,',In all manly arts and labors.',Swift of foot was Hiawatha;',He could shoot an arrow from him,',And run forward with such fleetness,',That the arrow fell behind him!',He could shoot ten arrows upward,',Shoot them with such strength and swiftness,',That the tenth had left the bow-string',Ere the first to earth had fallen!',He had mittens, Minjekahwun,',Magic mittens made of deer-skin;',When upon his hands he wore them,',He could smite the rocks asunder,',He could grind them into powder.',He had moccasins enchanted,',Magic moccasins of deer-skin;',When he bound them round his ankles,',When upon his feet he tied them,',At each stride a mile he measured!',Much he questioned old Nokomis',Of his father Mudjekeewis;',Learned from her the fatal secret',Of the beauty of his mother,',Of the falsehood of his father;',And his heart was hot within him,',Like a living coal his heart was.',Then he said to old Nokomis,',\"I will go to Mudjekeewis,',See how fares it with my father,',At the doorways of the West-Wind,',At the portals of the Sunset!\"',From his lodge went Hiawatha,',Dressed for travel, armed for hunting;',Dressed in deer-skin shirt and leggings,',Richly wrought with quills and wampum;',On his head his eagle-feathers,',Round his waist his belt of wampum,',In his hand his bow of ash-wood,',Strung with sinews of the reindeer;',In his quiver oaken arrows,',Tipped with jasper, winged with feathers;',With his mittens, Minjekahwun,',With his moccasins enchanted.',Warning said the old Nokomis,',\"Go not forth, O Hiawatha!',To the kingdom of the West-Wind,',To the realms of Mudjekeewis,',Lest he harm you with his magic,',Lest he kill you with his cunning!\"',But the fearless Hiawatha',Heeded not her woman's warning;',Forth he strode into the forest,',At each stride a mile he measured;',Lurid seemed the sky above him,',Lurid seemed the earth beneath him,',Hot and close the air around him,',Filled with smoke and fiery vapors,',As of burning woods and prairies,',For his heart was hot within him,',Like a living coal his heart was.',So he journeyed westward, westward,',Left the fleetest deer behind him,',Left the antelope and bison;',Crossed the rushing Esconaba,',Crossed the mighty Mississippi,',Passed the land of Crows and Foxes,',Passed the dwellings of the Blackfeet,',Came unto the Rocky Mountains,',To the kingdom of the West-Wind,',Where upon the gusty summits',Sat the ancient Mudjekeewis,',Ruler of the winds of heaven.',Filled with awe was Hiawatha',At the aspect of his father.',On the air about him wildly',Tossed and streamed his cloudy tresses,',Gleamed like drifting snow his tresses,',Glared like Ishkoodah, the comet,',Like the star with fiery tresses.',Filled with joy was Mudjekeewis',When he looked on Hiawatha,',Saw his youth rise up before him',In the face of Hiawatha,',Saw the beauty of Wenonah',From the grave rise up before him.',\"Welcome!\" said he, \"Hiawatha,',To the kingdom of the West-Wind',Long have I been waiting for you',Youth is lovely, age is lonely,',Youth is fiery, age is frosty;',You bring back the days departed,',You bring back my youth of passion,',And the beautiful Wenonah!\"',Many days they talked together,',Questioned, listened, waited, answered;',Much the mighty Mudjekeewis',Boasted of his ancient prowess,',Of his perilous adventures,',His indomitable courage,',His invulnerable body.',Listening to his father's boasting;',With a smile he sat and listened,',Uttered neither threat nor menace,',Neither word nor look betrayed him,',But his heart was hot within him,',Like a living coal his heart was.',Then he said, \"O Mudjekeewis,',Is there nothing that can harm you?',Nothing that you are afraid of?\"',And the mighty Mudjekeewis,',Grand and gracious in his boasting,',Answered, saying, \"There is nothing,',Nothing but the black rock yonder,',Nothing but the fatal Wawbeek!\"',And he looked at Hiawatha',With a wise look and benignant,',With a countenance paternal,',Looked with pride upon the beauty',Of his tall and graceful figure,',Is there anything can harm you?',Anything you are afraid of?\"',But the wary Hiawatha',Paused awhile, as if uncertain,',Held his peace, as if resolving,',And then answered, \"There is nothing,',Nothing but the bulrush yonder,',Nothing but the great Apukwa!\"',And as Mudjekeewis, rising,',Stretched his hand to pluck the bulrush,',Hiawatha cried in terror,',Cried in well-dissembled terror,',\"Kago! kago! do not touch it!\"',\"Ah, kaween!\" said Mudjekeewis,',\"No indeed, I will not touch it!\"',Then they talked of other matters;',First of Hiawatha's brothers,',Then of Hiawatha's mother,',Of the beautiful Wenonah,',Of her birth upon the meadow,',Of her death, as old Nokomis',Had remembered and related.',And he cried, \"O Mudjekeewis,',It was you who killed Wenonah,',Took her young life and her beauty,',Trampled it beneath your footsteps;',You confess it! you confess it!\"',And the mighty Mudjekeewis',Tossed upon the wind his tresses,',Bowed his hoary head in anguish,',With a silent nod assented.',Then up started Hiawatha,',And with threatening look and gesture',Laid his hand upon the black rock,',On the fatal Wawbeek laid it,',With his mittens, Minjekahwun,',Rent the jutting crag asunder,',Smote and crushed it into fragments,',Hurled them madly at his father,',The remorseful Mudjekeewis,',For his heart was hot within him,',Like a living coal his heart was.',But the ruler of the West-Wind',Blew the fragments backward from him,',With the breathing of his nostrils,',With the tempest of his anger,',Blew them back at his assailant;',Seized the bulrush, the Apukwa,',Dragged it with its roots and fibres',From the margin of the meadow,',From its ooze the giant bulrush;',Long and loud laughed Hiawatha!',Then began the deadly conflict,',Hand to hand among the mountains;',From his eyry screamed the eagle,',The Keneu, the great war-eagle,',Sat upon the crags around them,',Wheeling flapped his wings above them.',Like a tall tree in the tempest',Bent and lashed the giant bulrush;',And in masses huge and heavy',"]},"metadata":{"tags":[]},"execution_count":42}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"X2PbBrlOZ5e4","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1629299737168,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":3303,"user":{"displayName":"Giorgio

long nose and nostrils,\\',The black muffle of the nostrils,\\',Out of which the heavy breathing\\',Warmed the hands of Mudjekeewis.\\',Then he  <mask> aloft his war-club,\\',Shouted loud and long his war-cry,\\',Smote the mighty Mishe-Mokwa\\',In the middle of the forehead,\\',Right between the eyes he  <mask> him.\\',With the heavy blow bewildered,\\',Rose the Great Bear of the mountains;\\',But

West-Wind,\\',Gave the others to his children;\\',Unto Wabun  <mask> the East-Wind,\\',And the North-Wind, wild and  <mask> the fierce Kabibonokka.\\',Young and beautiful was Wabun;\\',He it was who  <mask> the morning,\\',He it was whose silver  <mask> the dark o\\'er hill and valley;\\',He it was whose cheeks were painted\\',With the brightest streaks of crimson,\\',And whose voice  <mask> the village,\\',Called the deer, and  <mask> the hunter. <mask> the birds  <mask> to  <mask> the wild-flowers of the meadow\\',Filled the air with odors for him;\\',Though the forests and the rivers\\',Sang and  <mask> at his coming,\\',Still his heart was sad within him,\\',For he was alone in heaven.\\',But one morning,  <mask> earthward,\\',While the village still was sleeping,\\',And the fog  <mask> on the river,\\',Like a ghost, that  <mask> at sunrise,\\',He beheld a maiden walking\\',All alone upon a  <mask> water-flags and rushes\\',By a river in the meadow.\\',Every morning,  <mask> earthward,\\',Still the first thing he  <mask>  <mask> her blue eyes  <mask> at him,\\',Two blue lakes among the rushes.\\',And he  <mask> the lonely maiden,\\',Who thus  <mask> for his coming;\\',For they both were solitary,\\',She on earth and he in heaven.\\',And he  <mask> her with caresses,\\',Wooed her with his smile of sunshine,\\',With his flattering words he  <mask> her,\\',With his sighing and his singing,\\',Gentlest  <mask> in the branches,\\',Softest music, sweetest odors,\\',Till he  <mask> her to his  <mask> in his robes of crimson,\\',Till into a star he  <mask> her,\\',Trembling still upon his bosom;\\',And forever in the heavens\\',They are  <mask> together walking,\\',But the fierce Kabibonokka\\',Had his dwelling among icebergs,\\',In the everlasting snow-drifts,\\',In the kingdom of Wabasso,\\',In the land of the White Rabbit.\\',He it was whose hand in Autumn\\',Painted all the trees with  <mask> the leaves with red and yellow;\\',He it was who  <mask> the snow-flake,\\',Sifting,  <mask> through the forest,\\',Froze the ponds, the lakes, the rivers,\\',Drove the loon and sea-gull southward,\\',Drove the cormorant and  <mask> their nests of sedge and sea-tang\\',In the realms of Shawondasee.\\',Once the fierce Kabibonokka\\',Issued from his lodge of snow-drifts\\',From his home among the icebergs,\\',And his hair, with snow besprinkled,\\',Streamed behind him like a river,\\',Like a black and wintry river,\\',As he  <mask> and  <mask> southward,\\',Over frozen lakes and moorlands.\\',There among the reeds and rushes\\',Found he Shingebis, the diver,\\',Trailing strings of fish behind him,\\',O\\'er the frozen fens and moorlands,\\',Lingering still among the moorlands,\\',Though his tribe had long departed\\',To the land of Shawondasee. <mask> the fierce Kabibonokka,\\',\"Who is this that  <mask> to  <mask> me?\\',Dares to  <mask> in my dominions,\\',When the Wawa has departed,\\',When the wild-goose has  <mask> southward,\\',And the heron, the Shuh-shuh-gah,\\',Long ago  <mask> southward?\\',I  <mask>  <mask> into his wigwam,\\',I  <mask>  <mask> his smouldering fire out!\"\\',And at night Kabibonokka,\\',To the lodge  <mask> wild and  <mask> the snow in drifts about  <mask> down into the smoke- <mask> the lodge-poles in his fury,\\',Flapped the curtain of the door-way.\\',Shingebis, the diver,  <mask> not,\\',Shingebis, the diver,  <mask> not;\\',Four great logs had he for firewood,\\',One for each moon of the winter,\\',And for food the fishes  <mask> him.\\',By his  <mask> fire he  <mask> there,\\',Warm and merry, eating, laughing,\\',You are but my fellow-mortal!\"\\',Then Kabibonokka entered,\\',And though Shingebis, the diver,\\',Felt his presence by the coldness,\\',Felt his icy breath upon him,\\',Still he did not  <mask> his singing,\\',Still he did not  <mask> his laughing,\\',Only  <mask> the log a little,\\',Only  <mask> the fire  <mask> brighter,\\',Made the sparks  <mask> up the smoke-flue.\\',From Kabibonokka\\'s forehead,\\',From his snow- <mask> tresses,\\',Drops of sweat  <mask> fast and heavy,\\',Making dints upon the ashes,\\',As along the eaves of lodges,\\',As from  <mask> boughs of hemlock,\\',Drips the  <mask> snow in spring-time,\\',Making hollows in the snow-drifts.\\',Till at last he  <mask> defeated,\\',Could not  <mask> the heat and  <mask> not  <mask> the merry singing,\\',But  <mask> headlong through the door- <mask> upon the crusted snow- <mask> upon the lakes and  <mask> the snow upon them  <mask> the ice upon them thicker,\\',Challenged Shingebis, the diver,\\',To  <mask> forth and  <mask> with him,\\',To  <mask> forth and  <mask>  <mask> the frozen fens and moorlands.\\',Forth  <mask> Shingebis, the  <mask> all night with the North- <mask> naked on the moorlands\\',With the fierce Kabibonokka,\\',Till his  <mask> breath  <mask> fainter,\\',Till his frozen grasp  <mask> feebler,\\',Till he  <mask> and staggered backward,\\',And  <mask> ,  <mask> , beaten,\\',To the kingdom of Wabasso,\\',To the land of the White Rabbit,\\',Hearing still the gusty laughter,\\',Hearing Shingebis, the diver,\\',You are but my fellow-mortal!\"\\',Shawondasee, fat and  <mask> his dwelling far to southward,\\',In the drowsy, dreamy sunshine,\\',In the never-ending Summer.\\',He it was who  <mask> the wood-birds,\\',Sent the robin, the Opechee,\\',Sent the bluebird, the Owaissa,\\',Sent the Shawshaw,  <mask> the swallow,\\',Sent the wild-goose, Wawa, northward,\\',Sent the melons and tobacco,\\',And the grapes in purple clusters. <mask> his pipe the smoke  <mask> the sky with haze and  <mask> the air with dreamy softness,\\',Gave a twinkle to the water,\\',Touched the rugged hills with smoothness,\\',Brought the tender Indian Summer\\',To the melancholy north- <mask> the dreary Moon of Snow-shoes.\\',Listless, careless Shawondasee!\\',In his life he had one shadow,\\',In his heart one sorrow had he.\\',Once, as he was  <mask> northward,\\',Far away upon a prairie\\',He beheld a maiden standing,\\',Saw a tall and slender maiden\\',All alone upon a prairie;\\',Brightest green were all her garments,\\',And her hair was like the sunshine.\\',Day by day he  <mask> upon her,\\',Day by day he  <mask> with passion,\\',Day by day his heart within him\\',Grew more hot with love and  <mask> the maid with yellow tresses.\\',But he was too fat and lazy\\',To  <mask> himself and  <mask> her.\\',Yes, too indolent and easy\\',To  <mask> her and  <mask> her;\\',So he only  <mask> upon her,\\',Only  <mask> and  <mask> with passion\\',For the maiden of the prairie.\\',Till one morning,  <mask> northward,\\',He beheld her yellow tresses\\',Changed and  <mask> o\\'er with whiteness,\\',Covered as with whitest snow- <mask> .\\',\"Ah! my brother from the North-land,\\',From the kingdom of Wabasso,\\',From the land of the White Rabbit!\\',You have  <mask> the maiden from me,\\',You have  <mask> your hand upon her,\\',You have  <mask> and  <mask> my maiden,\\',With your stories of the North-land!\"\\',Thus the wretched Shawondasee\\',Breathed into the air his sorrow;\\',And the South-Wind  <mask> the  <mask> warm with sighs of passion,\\',With the sighs of Shawondasee,\\',Till the air  <mask> full of snow-flakes,\\',Full of thistle-down the prairie,\\',And the maid with hair like  <mask> from his sight forever;\\',Never more did Shawondasee\\',See the maid with yellow tresses!\\',Poor,  <mask> Shawondasee!\\',\\'T was no woman that you  <mask> at,\\',\\'T was no maiden that you  <mask> for,\\',\\'T was the prairie dandelion\\',That through all the dreamy Summer\\',You had  <mask> at with such longing,\\',You had  <mask> for with such passion,\\',And had  <mask> away  <mask> into the air with sighing.\\',Ah!  <mask> Shawondasee!\\',Thus the Four Winds were divided\\',Thus the sons of Mudjekeewis\\',Had their stations in the heavens,\\',At the corners of the heavens;\\',For himself the West-Wind only\\',Kept the mighty Mudjekeewis.\\',Hiawatha\\'s Childhood\\',Downward through the evening twilight,\\',In the days that are forgotten,\\',In the unremembered ages,\\',From the full moon  <mask> Nokomis,\\',Fell the beautiful Nokomis,\\',She a wife, but not a mother.\\',She was  <mask> with her women,\\',Swinging in a swing of grape-vines,\\',When her rival the rejected,\\',Full of jealousy and hatred,\\',Cut the leafy swing asunder,\\',Cut in twain the twisted grape-vines,\\',And Nokomis  <mask> affrighted\\',Downward through the evening twilight,\\',On the Muskoday, the meadow,\\',On the prairie full of blossoms.\\',\"See! a star  <mask> !\"  <mask> the people;\\',\"From the sky a star is falling!\"\\',There among the ferns and mosses,\\',There among the prairie lilies,\\',On the Muskoday, the meadow,\\',In the moonlight and the starlight,\\',Fair Nokomis  <mask> a daughter.\\',And she  <mask> her name Wenonah,\\',As the first- <mask> of her daughters.\\',And the daughter of Nokomis\\',Grew up like the prairie lilies,\\',Grew a tall and slender maiden,\\',With the beauty of the moonlight,\\',With the beauty of the starlight.\\',And Nokomis  <mask> her  <mask> oft, and oft repeating,\\',\"Oh, beware of Mudjekeewis,\\',Listen not to what he

the West-Wind  <mask> at  <mask> lightly  <mask> the prairie,\\',Whispering to the leaves and  <mask> low the flowers and  <mask> the beautiful Wenonah,\\',Lying there among the lilies,\\',Wooed her with his words of sweetness,\\',Wooed her with his soft caresses,\\',Till she  <mask> a son in sorrow,\\',Bore a son of love and sorrow.\\',Thus was  <mask> my Hiawatha,\\',Thus was  <mask> the child of wonder;\\',But the daughter of Nokomis,\\',Hiawatha\\'s gentle mother,\\',In her anguish  <mask> deserted\\',By the West-Wind, false and faithless,\\',By the heartless Mudjekeewis.\\',For her

soft in moss and rushes,\\',Safely  <mask> with reindeer  <mask> his fretful wail by saying,\\',\"Hush! the Naked Bear  <mask>  <mask>  <mask> him into slumber, singing,\\',\"Ewa-yea! my little

northward\\',In the frosty nights of Winter;\\',Showed the broad white road in heaven,\\',Pathway of the ghosts, the shadows,\\',Running straight across the heavens,\\',Crowded with the ghosts, the shadows. <mask> the door on summer evenings\\',Sat the little Hiawatha;\\',Heard the whispering of the pine-trees,\\',Heard the lapping of the waters,\\',Sounds of music, words of wonder;\\',\"Minne-wawa!\"  <mask> the Pine-trees,\\',\"Mudway-aushka!\"  <mask> the water. <mask> the fire-fly, Wah-wah-taysee,\\',Flitting through the dusk of evening,\\',With the twinkle of its

 <mask> , \"Nokomis?\"\\',And the good Nokomis answered:\\',\"That is but the owl and owlet,\\',Talking in their native language,\\',Talking,  <mask> at each other. <mask> the little Hiawatha\\',Learned of every bird its  <mask> their names and all their secrets,\\',How they  <mask> their nests in Summer,\\',Where they  <mask> themselves in  <mask> with them  <mask> he  <mask> them,\\',Called them \"Hiawatha\\'s Chickens.\"\\',Of all beasts he  <mask> the language,\\',Learned their names and all their secrets,\\',How the beavers  <mask> their lodges,\\',Where the squirrels  <mask> their acorns,\\',How the reindeer  <mask> so swiftly,\\',Why the rabbit was so timid,\\',Talked with them  <mask> he  <mask> them,\\',Called them \"Hiawatha\\'s Brothers.\"\\',Then Iagoo, the great boaster,\\',He the marvellous story-teller,\\',He the traveller and the talker,\\',He the friend of old Nokomis,\\',From a branch of ash he  <mask> it,\\',From an oak-bough  <mask> the arrows,\\',Tipped with flint, and  <mask> with feathers,\\',And the cord he  <mask> of deer-skin.\\',Then he  <mask> to Hiawatha:\\',\"Go, my son, into the forest,\\',Where the red deer herd together,\\',Kill for us a famous roebuck,\\',Kill for us a deer with antlers!\"\\',Forth into the forest straightway\\',All alone  <mask> Hiawatha\\',Proudly, with his bow and arrows;\\',And the birds  <mask> round him, o\\'er him,\\',\"Do not  <mask> us, Hiawatha!\"\\',Sang the robin, the Opechee,\\',Sang the bluebird, the Owaissa,\\',\"Do not  <mask> us,  <mask> the oak-tree, close beside him,\\',Sprang the squirrel, Adjidaumo,\\',In and out among the  <mask> and  <mask> from the oak-tree,\\',Laughed, and  <mask> between his laughing,\\',\"Do not  <mask> me,  <mask> the rabbit from his  <mask> aside, and at a distance\\',Sat erect upon his haunches,\\',Half in fear and half in  <mask> to the little hunter,\\',\"Do not  <mask> me, Hiawatha!\"\\',But he  <mask> not, nor  <mask> them,\\',For his thoughts were with the red deer;\\',On their tracks his eyes were  <mask> downward to the river,\\',To the ford across the river,\\',And as one in slumber  <mask> he.\\',Hidden in the alder-bushes,\\',There he  <mask> till the deer came,\\',Till he  <mask> two antlers lifted,\\',Saw two eyes  <mask> from the thicket,\\',Saw two nostrils point to  <mask> a deer  <mask> down the  <mask> with leafy light and  <mask> .\\',And his heart within him  <mask> like the leaves above  <mask> the birch-leaf palpitated,\\',As the deer  <mask> down the pathway.\\',Then, upon one knee uprising,\\',Hiawatha  <mask> an arrow;\\',Scarce a twig  <mask> with his motion,\\',Scarce a leaf was  <mask> or rustled,\\',But the wary roebuck started,\\',Stamped with all his hoofs  <mask> with one foot uplifted,\\',Leaped as if to  <mask> the arrow;\\',Ah! the singing, fatal arrow,\\',Like a wasp it  <mask> and  <mask> him!\\',Dead he  <mask> there in the forest,\\',By the ford across the river;\\',Beat his timid heart no longer,\\',But the heart of Hiawatha\\',Throbbed and  <mask> and exulted,\\',As he  <mask> the red deer  <mask> his  <mask> with applauses. <mask> the red deer\\'s hide Nokomis\\',Made a cloak for Hiawatha,\\',From the red deer\\'s flesh Nokomis\\',Made a banquet to his honor.\\',All the village  <mask> and feasted,\\',All the guests  <mask> Hiawatha,\\',Called him Strong-Heart, Soan-ge-taha!\\',Called him Loon-Heart, Mahn-go-taysee!\\',Out of childhood into manhood\\',Now had  <mask> my Hiawatha,\\',Skilled in all the craft of  <mask> in all the lore of old men,\\',In all youthful sports and pastimes,\\',In all manly arts and labors.\\',Swift of foot was Hiawatha;\\',He  <mask>  <mask> an arrow from him,\\',And  <mask> forward with such fleetness,\\',That the arrow  <mask> behind him!\\',He  <mask>  <mask> ten arrows upward,\\',Shoot them with such strength and swiftness,\\',That the tenth had  <mask> the bow-string\\',Ere the first to earth had fallen!\\',He had mittens, Minjekahwun,\\',Magic mittens  <mask> of deer-skin;\\',When upon his hands he  <mask> them,\\',He  <mask>  <mask> the rocks asunder,\\',He  <mask>  <mask> them into powder.\\',He had moccasins enchanted,\\',Magic moccasins of deer-skin;\\',When he  <mask> them round his ankles,\\',When upon his feet he  <mask> them,\\',At each stride a mile he  <mask> he  <mask> old Nokomis\\',Of his father  <mask> from her the fatal secret\\',Of the beauty of his mother,\\',Of the falsehood of his father;\\',And his heart was hot within him,\\',Like a  <mask> coal his heart was.\\',Then he  <mask> to old Nokomis,\\',\"I  <mask>  <mask> to  <mask> how fares it with my father,\\',At the doorways of the West-Wind,\\',At the portals of the Sunset!\"\\',From his lodge  <mask> Hiawatha,\\',Dressed for travel,  <mask> for hunting;\\',Dressed in deer-skin shirt and leggings,\\',Richly  <mask> with quills and  <mask> his head his eagle-feathers,\\',Round his waist his belt of  <mask> his hand his bow of ash-wood,\\',Strung with sinews of the reindeer;\\',In his quiver  <mask>  <mask> with jasper,  <mask> with feathers;\\',With his mittens, Minjekahwun,\\',With his moccasins  <mask> .\\',Warning  <mask> the old Nokomis,\\',\"Go not forth, O Hiawatha!\\',To the kingdom of the West-Wind,\\',To the realms of Mudjekeewis,\\',Lest he  <mask> you with his magic,\\',Lest he  <mask> you with his cunning!\"\\',But the fearless Hiawatha\\',Heeded not her woman\\'s warning;\\',Forth he  <mask> into the forest,\\',At each stride a mile he measured;\\',Lurid  <mask> the sky above him,\\',Lurid  <mask> the earth beneath him,\\',Hot and  <mask> the air around him,\\',Filled with smoke and fiery vapors,\\',As of  <mask> woods and prairies,\\',For his heart was hot within him,\\',Like a  <mask> coal his heart was.\\',So he  <mask> westward, westward,\\',Left the fleetest deer behind him,\\',Left the antelope and  <mask> the rushing  <mask> the mighty  <mask> the land of Crows and  <mask> the dwellings of the Blackfeet,\\',Came unto the Rocky Mountains,\\',To the kingdom of the West-Wind,\\',Where upon the gusty summits\\',Sat the ancient Mudjekeewis,\\',Ruler of the winds of heaven. <mask> with awe was Hiawatha\\',At the aspect of his father.\\',On the air about him  <mask> and  <mask> his cloudy tresses,\\',Gleamed like  <mask> snow his tresses,\\',Glared like Ishkoodah, the comet,\\',Like the star with fiery tresses. <mask> with joy was Mudjekeewis\\',When he  <mask> on Hiawatha,\\',Saw his youth  <mask> up before him\\',In the face of Hiawatha,\\',Saw the beauty of Wenonah\\',From the grave  <mask> up before him.\\',\"Welcome!\"  <mask> he, \"Hiawatha,\\',To the kingdom of the West- <mask> have I been  <mask> for you\\',Youth is lovely, age is lonely,\\',Youth is fiery, age is frosty;\\',You  <mask> back the days departed,\\',You  <mask> back my youth of passion,\\',And the beautiful Wenonah!\"\\',Many days they  <mask>  <mask> ,  <mask> ,  <mask> ,  <mask> the mighty Mudjekeewis\\',Boasted of his ancient prowess,\\',Of his perilous adventures,\\',His indomitable courage,\\',His invulnerable body. <mask> to his father\\'s boasting;\\',With a smile he  <mask> and  <mask> neither threat nor menace,\\',Neither word nor  <mask>  <mask> him,\\',But his heart was hot within him,\\',Like a  <mask> coal his heart was.\\',Then he  <mask> , \"O Mudjekeewis,\\',Is there nothing that  <mask>  <mask>  <mask> that you are afraid of?\"\\',And the mighty Mudjekeewis,\\',Grand and gracious in his boasting,\\',Answered,  <mask> , \"There is nothing,\\',Nothing but the black rock yonder,\\',Nothing but the fatal Wawbeek!\"\\',And he  <mask> at Hiawatha\\',With a wise look and benignant,\\',With a countenance  <mask> with pride upon the beauty\\',Of his tall and graceful figure,\\',Is there anything  <mask>  <mask> you?\\',Anything you are afraid of?\"\\',But the wary Hiawatha\\',Paused awhile, as if uncertain,\\',Held his peace, as if resolving,\\',And then  <mask> , \"There is nothing,\\',Nothing but the bulrush yonder,\\',Nothing but the great Apukwa!\"\\',And as Mudjekeewis,  <mask> his hand to  <mask> the bulrush,\\',Hiawatha  <mask> in  <mask> in well- <mask> terror,\\',\"Kago! kago! do not  <mask> it!\"\\',\"Ah, kaween!\"  <mask> Mudjekeewis,\\',\"No indeed, I  <mask> not  <mask> it!\"\\',Then they  <mask> of other matters;\\',First of Hiawatha\\'s brothers,\\',Then of Hiawatha\\'s mother,\\',Of the beautiful Wenonah,\\',Of her birth upon the meadow,\\',Of her death, as old Nokomis\\',Had  <mask> and related.\\',And he  <mask> , \"O Mudjekeewis,\\',It was you who  <mask> Wenonah,\\',Took her young life and her  <mask> it beneath your footsteps;\\',You  <mask> it! you  <mask>  <mask> the mighty Mudjekeewis\\',Tossed upon the wind his tresses,\\',Bowed his hoary head in anguish,\\',With a silent nod  <mask> .\\',Then up  <mask> Hiawatha,\\',And with
